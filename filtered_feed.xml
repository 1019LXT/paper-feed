Abstract: Oxygen transport membranes (OTMs), enabling catalytic reaction and gas separation, support crucial chemical engineering processes and decarbonization technologies, but their applications are hindered by limited oxygen permeation fluxes and inadequate long-term stability during operation. Here, a series of high-entropy perovskite OTMs based on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 were designed and synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. The impact of varying doping ratios on the structure, surface morphology, oxygen permeability, and stability of these high-entropy OTMs was thoroughly examined. At 950 {\deg}C, the optimal composition, La0.25Sr0.25Gd0.2Nd0.2Pr0.1CoO3, achieved oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.62 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/He gradient and 1.46 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/CO2, respectively. Remarkably, all high-entropy OTMs demonstrated stable operation for over 100 h in a pure CO2 environment without a significant decline in performance. This finding paves a new way to enhance the structural and oxygen permeation stability of OTMs, and further promotes the application of OTMs in oxy-fuel combustion technologies aimed at improving CO2 capture and storage efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] ML-guided screening of chalcogenide perovskites as solar energy materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21812</link><description>arXiv:2602.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as promising absorber materials for next-generation photovoltaic devices, yet their experimental realization remains limited by competing phases, structural polymorphism, and synthetic challenges. Here, we present a fully data-driven and experimentally grounded screening and ranking framework to assess the stability and experimental feasibility of chalcogenide perovskites, integrating interpretable analytical descriptors, machine-learning models, and sustainability metrics. Using a curated experimental dataset of halide and chalcogenide compounds, we derive a new tolerance factor via the SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) algorithm that more accurately distinguishes perovskite-forming compositions than established tolerance-factor-based screening criteria. This descriptor is combined with generative crystal structure prediction, composition-based bandgap estimation, and machine-learning-based feasibility assessment to systematically explore a wide chemical space of hypothetical chalcogenide perovskites. The resulting candidates are further evaluated using sustainability indicators, enabling multi-objective ranking tailored to both single-junction and tandem photovoltaic architectures. Beyond identifying several promising and previously unexplored chalcogenide perovskites, this work demonstrates a transferable screening strategy for chemically constrained materials spaces that balances optoelectronic performance, experimental viability, and long-term sustainability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Intrinsic Instabilities and Mechanical Anisotropy in Halide Perovskite Monolayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21989</link><description>arXiv:2602.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have been extensively studied owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties and their unique lattice characteristics, that are very soft and anharmonic. Recent studies indicate the importance of a deep understanding of their surfaces and, in the limit, the properties of low-dimensional structures based on these materials. To investigate the structural and electronic properties of halide perovskite monolayers (i.e., perovskenes), this work uses first-principles simulations. We have studied three different stoichiometries (ABX3, ABX4, and A2BX4) and structural phases for iodide, bromide, and chloride perovskite monolayers. Their thermodynamic behavior was evaluated through the construction of phase diagrams, highlighting the instability of the ABX4 stoichiometry, which was further supported by its mechanical instability. Structurally, the covalent characteristics of the Pb--X bond, in contrast to the Cs--X bonds, induce a strong anisotropy in the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along different crystallographic directions, and also account for the lower stiffness observed in the phases where the octahedra are not aligned. The electronic properties are somewhat similar to those of their 3D counterparts, but with a slightly larger band gap; in the monolayers, the band gap increases with halogen electronegativity (I, Br, Cl) and octahedral tilting. Moreover, the non-symmetric ABX3 stoichiometry exhibited a spin splitting due to the internal dipole moment in these layers. Overall, our work lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of low-dimensional structures based on halide perovskites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21989v1</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today] The intrinsic instability of lead halide perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702126000970?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: May 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Materials Today, Volume 94&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Lixiu Zhang, Xiaoxue Ren, Feng Gao, Jiangjian Shi, Yuanhang Cheng, Shaobing Xiong, Jianming Yang, Xiao Wang, Lingfeng Chao, Yonghua Chen, Qing Zhao, Qi Chen, Shuping Pang, Qinye Bao, Yueyue Gao, Junqiao Ding, Qingbo Meng, Yongbo Yuan, Ke Jin, Liming Ding&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:05:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702126000970</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Joule] Integrating SWCNT to bridge the stability divide in scalable and manufacturable flexible perovskite solar modules</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125004064?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 21 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Joule, Volume 10, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Jing Zhang, Yu Meng, An-Ping Wu, Chengkai Jin, Peng-Xiang Hou, Weidong Xu, Dimitar I.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a long-standing challenge in materials science, with most data-driven methods developed for inorganic systems. This leaves an important gap for organic crystals, which are central to pharmaceuticals, polymers, and functional materials, but present unique challenges, such as larger unit cells and strict chemical connectivity. We introduce a flow-matching model for predicting organic crystal structures directly from molecular graphs. The architecture integrates molecular connectivity with periodic boundary conditions while preserving the symmetries of crystalline systems. A bond-aware loss guides the model toward realistic local chemistry by enforcing distributions of bond lengths and connectivity. To support reliable and efficient training, we built a curated dataset of organic crystals, along with a preprocessing pipeline that precomputes bonds and edges, substantially reducing computational overhead during both training and inference. Experiments show that our method achieves a Match Rate more than 10 times higher than existing baselines while requiring fewer sampling steps for inference. These results establish generative modeling as a practical and scalable framework for organic crystal structure prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phonon frequency comb close to an isolated Einstein mode in InSiTe3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20747</link><description>arXiv:2602.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of phonon frequency combs exemplifies a rare and intriguing phenomenon in quantum solids. Materials with distinctive phonon band structures are especially promising for hosting such states, as their vibrational dispersion landscape across the Brillouin zone can facilitate the formation of long-lived, collective lattice excitations. In the layered Van der Waals compound InSiTe$_3$, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy reveals a pronounced anharmonicity in symmetry-predicted modes and the formation of a self-organized frequency domain structure (coherent-like state), in the range of a localized highenergy A$_{1g}$ phonon mode near 500 cm$^{-1}$. This strong phonon-phonon coupling manifests itself as an anomalous temperature dependence around 200 K, coinciding with the appearance of higher-order excitations within the phonon density of states gap. These findings position InSiTe$_3$ as an unconventional platform where intrinsic highly structured phonon spectral correlations and unusually strong anharmonic effects coexist, opening new avenues for exploring emergent vibrational phenomena in low-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Optoelectronic Properties of Anharmonic Solid Solutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20778</link><description>arXiv:2602.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging strong optoelectronic responses to external stimuli, such as temperature and electric fields, is central to the development of advanced photonic technologies, including adaptive photodetectors and reconfigurable photovoltaic devices. However, only a limited number of semiconducting materials, typically characterized by strong electron-phonon coupling, are known to exhibit such pronounced responsiveness, and their equilibrium optoelectronic properties are often not optimally suited for targeted applications. Chemical engineering strategies, such as doping and solid-solution mixing, are therefore widely employed to fine-tune the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors. Predicting the impact of such modifications, however, remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of chemically disordered and anharmonic systems, as well as the computational limitations of conventional first-principles approaches. In this work, we introduce a new computational framework that combines ab initio electronic-structure methods with machine-learning techniques to achieve first-principles precision in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of anharmonic solid solutions at finite temperature. We apply this approach to silver chalco-halide solid solutions, an emergent class of optoelectronic materials that have been experimentally shown to exhibit large band-gap tunability and strong responses to thermal excitations. Our results provide quantitative insight into the interplay between chemical disorder, lattice dynamics, and electronic structure in these materials. More broadly, this study establishes a general strategy for the accurate modeling of optoelectronic functionality in chemically disordered semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetr: a Python package for determining symmetry properties of crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21034</link><description>arXiv:2602.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter compounds typically form crystals, which break the rotational and translational invariance of space but remain invariant under a discrete set of symmetry operations. Understanding the effects allowed by this symmetry breaking, as well as the constraints imposed by the crystal structure, is a crucial problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a Python package for determining the symmetry-restricted forms of tensors describing physical properties of crystals, focusing particularly on magnetic materials. The primary focus is on response tensors; however, the program can also describe equilibrium properties and other physical properties, such as magnetic interactions. The program can describe the symmetry using the conventional magnetic space groups, as well as using the spin groups that describe the non-relativistic limit. Additional functionality includes the treatment of quantities projected onto a particular site and expansions in the magnetic order parameter. The code can be used either from the command line or via a Python API.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning-enabled inverse design of bimaterial thermoelastic lattice metamaterials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20173</link><description>arXiv:2602.20173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelastic metamaterial based on a bimaterial hybrid-honeycomb structure, exhibiting simultaneously negative Poisson's ratios and negative thermal expansion coefficients is very promising for various application. This work is dedicated to the machine learning (ML)-enabled inverse design of such structure, on the basis of high-throughput simulation and neural network models. A large dataset is generated through computational homogenization of structures with varying geometrical features and base material properties. A forward ML model is first trained to efficiently and accurately predict the effective thermoelastic properties for a given structure design. Subsequently, inverse ML models are developed to suggest geometrical features and base materials for desired target properties. To address various inverse design scenarios, six different models are proposed, each defined by different combinations of target effective properties and structural design variables. The trained forward model is integrated into the loss functions of the inverse models and is also employed to generate additional datasets for cases with fixed base materials. The good predictive performance of the forward and inverse ML models is demonstrated by representative design examples. These ML models can be applied to efficiently solving specific inverse design tasks involved in the practical application of the thermoelastic metamaterial in novel engineering systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-based phenomenological characterization of cross-modal bias in multimodal models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20624</link><description>arXiv:2602.20624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term 'algorithmic fairness' is used to evaluate whether AI models operate fairly in both comparative (where fairness is understood as formal equality, such as "treat like cases as like") and non-comparative (where unfairness arises from the model's inaccuracy, arbitrariness, or inscrutability) contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Localization of information driven by stochastic resetting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07394</link><description>arXiv:2510.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: We show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$ and a dynamical exponent $z=2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07394v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10997</link><description>arXiv:2601.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10997v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetopological mechanics in Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12168</link><description>arXiv:2602.12168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12168v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18659</link><description>arXiv:2602.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18659v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Solid State Ionics] Machine learning molecular dynamics investigation on cation diffusion mechanisms in Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ferrite and its homogeneous interfaces</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167273826000408?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 1 May 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Solid State Ionics, Volume 439&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Shihong Yu, Peng Bi, Jingsong Liu, Enzhu Li, Yong Yi&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Solid State Ionics</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:05:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167273826000408</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Energy] Photoswitchable isomers to improve grain boundary resilience and perovskite solar cells stability under light cycling</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-026-01993-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Energy, Published online: 25 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-026-01993-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41560-026-01993-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The operational stability of perovskite solar cells remains a challenge.

Abstract: This review explores the evolution of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and sensing, transitioning from fundamental studies of adsorption-desorption kinetics to the sophisticated sensing with Electropolymerized Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (E-MIPs). A significant portion of our previous research focuses on the optical properties, electrochromism of polymer dielectrics, and structure-order correlation in polymer brushes and hierarchical ultrathin films. We then address the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in data interpretation, culminating in the conceptualization of Self-Driving Labs (SDLs). The importance of generating high-quality training data through high-throughput experimentation (THE) with the SPR is a possibility. These autonomous systems represent the future of materials science, enabling the rapid, closed-loop discovery and optimization of next-generation SPR sensors and analytical methods. This overview highlights the trajectory for integrating conventional experimental design with AI-driven sensing and analytical chemistry across materials and biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18659</link><description>arXiv:2602.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18659v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Prediction of the atomistic Hubbard U interaction from moir\'e system STM-images using image recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18890</link><description>arXiv:2602.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomistic Hubbard interaction U, representing the on-site Coulomb repulsion, serves as a pivotal parameter in theoretical models describing of correlated systems, yet its precise experimental determination especially in moir\'e systems remains challenging. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy(STM) provides real-space images of the local density of states (LDOS), offering rich data sets that reflect the unique electronic structure of the material. Here, we introduce a systematic methodology for extracting the Hubbard U parameter directly from these LDOS images through the application of machine learning (ML) in the case of twisted bilayer graphene in the flat-band regime. The regression of U is highly accurate even though the image-similarity is greater than 99.98%.

Abstract: We present peapods (github.com/PeaBrane/peapods), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on arbitrary-dimensional hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen--Wang and Wolff cluster updates, and parallel tempering. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperature of the two-dimensional Ising model via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Improving Reliability of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials With Physics-Informed Pretraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19592</link><description>arXiv:2602.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with their competitive accuracy and computational efficiency. However, MLIPs are often observed to exhibit un-physical behavior when encountering configurations which deviate significantly from their training data distribution, leading to simulation instabilities and unreliable dynamics, thus limiting the reliability of MLIPs for materials simulations. We present a physics-informed pretraining strategy that leverages simple physical potentials which can improve the robustness and stability of graph-based MLIPs for MD simulations. We demonstrate this approach by deploying a pretraining-finetuning pipeline where MLIPs are initially pretrained on data labelled with embedded atom model potentials and subsequently finetuned on the quantum mechanical ground truth data. By evaluating across three diverse material systems (phosphorus, silica, and a subset of Materials Project) and three representative MLIP architectures (CGCNN, M3GNet, and TorchMD-NET), we find that this physics-informed pretraining consistently improves both prediction accuracy as well as stability in MD compared to the baselines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning protocol to identify pairing symmetries via quasiparticle interference imaging in Ising superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19791</link><description>arXiv:2602.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors is essential for reliably characterizing their superconducting states and for enabling their integration into realistic quantum devices. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-guided strategy to determine pairing symmetry from quasiparticle interference (QPI) data, which integrates first-principles calculations, tight-binding modeling, and symmetry-based classification of the superconducting pairing function. We demonstrate the approach on monolayer NbSe2 as an experimentally accessible probe of superconductivity in real materials, within a single scalar-impurity Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. Our analysis shows that the QPI-to-parameter inverse problem can be solved with high accuracy for most superconducting pairing channels in this setting, indicating that QPI carries rich, learnable information about the superconducting gap structure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that machine-learning-assisted QPI analysis provides a promising pathway for precise learning of superconducting pairing functions in quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Automated structure discovery for Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19932</link><description>arXiv:2602.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) provides nanoscale chemical fingerprints alongside high-resolution topographic mapping of molecules, offering a powerful tool for materials discovery. However, TERS image datasets are challenging to interpret and typically demand time-consuming, computationally intensive quantum-chemistry calculations. To overcome this problem, we present an encoder-decoder model trained and evaluated on simulated TERS images of planar molecules, enabling direct prediction of molecular structures from spectral simulated data with high accuracy. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automating molecular structure identification from TERS images, bypassing traditional manual analysis. These findings provide a foundation for extending machine learning methods to experimental TERS datasets, potentially accelerating molecular discovery by integrating nanoscale spectroscopy with automated computational analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The interplay of cation/anion and monovalent/divalent selectivity in negatively charged nanopores: local charge inversion and anion leakage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19992</link><description>arXiv:2602.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is widely regarded as a hallmark of calcium versus monovalent ion selectivity in negatively charged pores. While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\ anion selecivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The effect of the A-site cation on the phase transition temperature of metal halide perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20058</link><description>arXiv:2602.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for the practical application of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the instability of the desired perovskite phase relative to the optically non-active $\delta$ phase. To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coexisting magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20073</link><description>arXiv:2602.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with N\'eel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Beyond Optimization: Stress-Gated Dynamical Regime Regulation in Autonomous Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18581</link><description>arXiv:2602.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19888</link><description>arXiv:2602.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20427</link><description>arXiv:2503.20427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localisation of entropy production in complex processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of fluctuating entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localising entropy production.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.20427v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Boundary-driven magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain: Role of the system-bath coupling strength and timescales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16528</link><description>arXiv:2507.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the transport properties of quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Theoretical studies usually rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and boundary-driven dynamics governed by Markovian master equations for open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of approaches remains a largely open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ according to the two approaches, focusing on the specific example of magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain. Using exact numerical simulations for finite system sizes, we find (i) a clear mismatch between the two $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and (ii) a strong dependence of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ on the system-bath coupling strength for the open system, where neither (i) nor (ii) tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. These findings suggest limitations of the open-system approach to transport coefficients. To gain insight into the origin of (i) and (ii), we go beyond $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and analyze the full time dependence of the diffusion coefficient $D(t)$ in the open system. In this way, we find that both (i) and (ii) vanish up to a finite time scale. While this time scale gradually increases with system size and tends to be macroscopic in the thermodynamic limit, this increase is still slow compared to the increase of the time to reach the steady state, where (i) and (ii) do not vanish. This observation can be seen as a wrong, yet unavoidable order of limits of long times first and large system sizes afterwards.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16528v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films: Fundamental Limitation and Evaluation of Dielectric Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14725</link><description>arXiv:2509.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14725v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link><description>arXiv:2510.05339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dopants can tune the performance of MoS2 in various applications, but use of molecular dynamics simulations for doped MoS2 materials discovery is limited by the lack of multi-dopant interatomic potentials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) could be a solution, but the accuracy of these potentials must first be evaluated. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed MLIP, META's Universal Model for Atoms (UMA), for 25 different MoS2 dopants spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals in Mo substitution, S substitution, and intercalated positions by benchmarking the MLIP-predicted formation energy and the dopant-induced structural change against density functional theory calculations. The computational framework for MLIP validation and simulations are described in detail and the source code is made open source. The MLIP is then demonstrated by performing heating-cooling simulations of MoS2 supercells with all 25 dopants. These simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides a computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05339v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Design principles for amorphous solid-state electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23251</link><description>arXiv:2510.23251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23251v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00242</link><description>arXiv:2602.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00242v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link><description>arXiv:2507.05818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of halogenated carbon atomic wires (halopolyynes) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid and their comprehensive Raman characterization. Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that halogen terminations act as auxochromes through p-$\pi$ conjugation between their lone-pair electrons and the sp-carbon backbone, extending effective conjugation length. This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05818v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22173</link><description>arXiv:2601.22173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22173v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Machine learning guided resolution of mechanical trade-off in polymer composites via stress adaptive interface</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69872-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 24 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69872-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69872-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Developing polymer composites which combine high strength, toughness, and impact resistance remains challenging.

Abstract: A key problem of solid mechanics is the identification of the constitutive law of a material, that is, the relation between strain and stress. Machine learning has lead to considerable advances in this field lately. Here we introduce inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (iCKANs). This novel artificial neural network architecture can discover in an automated manner symbolic constitutive laws describing both the elastic and inelastic behavior of materials. That is, it can translate data from material testing into corresponding elastic and inelastic potential functions in closed mathematical form. We demonstrate the advantages of iCKANs using both synthetic data and experimental data of the viscoelastic polymer materials VHB 4910 and VHB 4905. The results demonstrate that iCKANs accurately capture complex viscoelastic behavior while preserving physical interpretability. It is a particular strength of iCKANs that they can process not only mechanical data but also arbitrary additional information available about a material (e.g., about temperature-dependent behavior). This makes iCKANs a powerful tool to discover in the future also how specific processing or service conditions affect the properties of materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] El Agente S\'olido: A New Age(nt) for Solid State Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17886</link><description>arXiv:2602.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry calculations are a key component of the materials discovery process. The results from first-principles explorations enable the prediction of material properties prior to experimental validation. Despite their impact, the practical use of first-principles methods remains limited by the expertise required to design, execute, and troubleshoot complex computational workflows. Even when workflows are successfully built, they are sometimes rigid and not adaptable to different use cases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems offer a pathway to flexibly automate these processes and lower barriers to entry. Here, we introduce El Agente S\'olido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package. The framework translates high-level scientific objectives expressed in natural language into end-to-end computational pipelines that include structure generation, input file construction, workflow execution, and post-processing analysis. El Agente S\'olido integrates density functional theory with phonon calculations and machine-learning interatomic potentials to enable efficient and physically consistent simulations. Extensive benchmarking and case studies demonstrate that El Agente S\'olido reliably executes a wide range of solid-state calculations, highlighting its potential to improve reproducibility and accelerate computational materials discovery</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Achieving Robust Extrapolation in Materials Property Prediction via Decoupled Transfer Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18054</link><description>arXiv:2602.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials property prediction, yet fails catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training distributions-precisely the capability required for discovering unprecedented materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit this collapse because end-to-end training fundamentally couples learned representations to target property distributions, preventing genuine extrapolation. We demonstrate that decoupled transfer learning-separating pretrained GNN feature extractors from simple regressors-overcomes this barrier. Pretrained features provide transferable structural knowledge, while simple regressors enable smooth extrapolation by maintaining learned trends beyond training boundaries. Benchmarked on layered intercalation compounds through four rigorous extrapolation scenarios and a temporal Materials Project split, our framework achieves 68% error reduction (RMSE: 0.881 vs. 2.778 eV/atom) versus end-to-end GNNs for extrapolation. Failure analysis reveals extrapolation succeeds for continuous chemical space but fails for discontinuous space, establishing clear design principles. Validated on Fermi energy prediction, this framework is immediately deployable using existing pretrained models, requiring no architectural innovations-transforming ML-driven materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-learning force-field models for dynamical simulations of metallic magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18213</link><description>arXiv:2602.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] RHEED pattern classification by a convolutional neural network for the growth of chalcogenide thin films and nanostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18243</link><description>arXiv:2602.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) plays a critical role for in-situ characterization in molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. While sensitive to crystal symmetries and morphology, it is used ubiquitously to determine the growth modes of thin films. However, analysis of RHEED patterns depends on skilled experts and is therefore difficult to incorporate into the growth strategy in real-time. The development of machine learning (ML) processes, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), presents a unique opportunity towards real-time RHEED pattern recognition. In this study, we develop a CNN model that can accurately classify four common and distinct RHEED patterns present in chalcogenide thin film growth. Its reached accuracy reached 94.9% for single run and 91.2% when averaged over 20 seeds. Our network is able to distinguish the nucleation of three common growth modes encountered in epitaxy, namely Volmer Weber, Stransky-Krastanov and Frank-van der Merwe, potentially enabling future automation of substrate temperature and shutter control informed by RHEED data. The network is material-agnostic and distinguishes the VW process with greater than 98% accuracy but is somewhat more limited in its ability to properly classify roughening and the initiation of Stransky-Krastanov growth. Our findings show that ML techniques can be successfully implemented even in cases where there is no detailed knowledge of growth chemistry providing an avenue towards real-time incorporation of ML to control nanostructure nucleation and thin film morphology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18335</link><description>arXiv:2602.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Identification of Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Species by Joint Characterization of Li-ion Battery Chemistry by Mass Spectrometry and Electro-Chemical Reaction Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17722</link><description>arXiv:2602.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) play a central role in determining the long-term performance and safety of modern electrochemical energy storage systems. Despite decades of research, the SEI's heterogeneous, dynamic, and multi-phase nature has defied comprehensive molecular-level characterization, creating a critical knowledge gap that limits rational battery design. In this work, we introduce a computational-experimental framework that integrates high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations, data-driven electro-chemical reaction networks (eCRNs), stochastic algorithms, and Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (LDI-FTICR-MS) to unravel SEI formation in carbonate-based electrolytes without imposing predefined mechanisms. We constructed the most comprehensive eCRN to date, spanning over 10,000 species and 209 million reactions. Through stochastic network analysis, we successfully recovered 27 species that were previously reported in literature and predicted 28 novel SEI species, nearly doubling our scientific knowledge in this area. Each new species was rigorously confirmed through advanced mass spectra analysis of its distinct molecular and isotopic signatures. We kinetically refined the formation pathways for a select set of both previously reported and novel SEI products, revealing kinetically feasible elementary reaction mechanisms with activation barriers below 1 eV. This computational-experimental approach deepens our molecular-level understanding of SEI chemistry and supports the rational design of advanced electrolytes and engineered interphases for next-generation lithium-based batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Clever Materials: When Models Identify Good Materials for the Wrong Reasons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17730</link><description>arXiv:2602.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Models perform impressively on many benchmarks. However, strong benchmark performance does not imply that a model learned chemistry. I test a concrete alternative hypothesis: that property prediction can be driven by bibliographic confounding. Across five tasks spanning MOFs (thermal and solvent stability), perovskite solar cells (efficiency), batteries (capacity), and TADF emitters (emission wavelength), models trained on standard chemical descriptors predict author, journal, and publication year well above chance. When these predicted metadata ("bibliographic fingerprints") are used as the sole input to a second model, performance is sometimes competitive with conventional descriptor-based predictors. These results show that many datasets do not rule out non-chemical explanations of success. Progress requires routine falsification tests (e.g., group/time splits and metadata ablations), datasets designed to resist spurious correlations, and explicit separation of two goals: predictive utility versus evidence of chemical understanding.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18146</link><description>arXiv:2602.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link><description>arXiv:2601.18852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18852v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18216</link><description>arXiv:2506.18216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.18216v3</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Data‐Guided Photocatalysis: Supervised Machine Learning in Water Splitting and CO2 Conversion</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500122?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 02:19:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500122</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Can We Automate Scientific Reasoning in Closed-Loop Experiments using Large Language Models?</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00520E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00520E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Abdoulatif  Cissé, Max  Cooper, Mengjia Zhu, Xenophon Evangelopoulos, Andrew Cooper&lt;br /&gt;We present here a detailed study of our hybrid optimisation framework, BORA, which integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with Bayesian optimisation (BO) for accelerating scientific discovery using closed-loop experiments....&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00520E</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multi-objective optimization and quantum hybridization of equivariant deep learning interatomic potentials on organic and inorganic compounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16908</link><description>arXiv:2602.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allegro is a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) model designed to predict atomic properties in molecules using E(3) equivariant neural networks. When training this model, there tends to be a trade-off between accuracy and inference time. For this reason we apply multi-objective hyperparameter optimization to the two objectives. Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17000</link><description>arXiv:2602.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rotational Soft Modes and Octahedral Distortion as Design Principles for Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halide Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17147</link><description>arXiv:2602.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in halide perovskites and related octahedral framework materials arises from two distinct and complementary mechanisms: (i) halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes that reshape the low-frequency spectrum and intensify phonon scattering, and (ii) static octahedral distortions that further enhance anharmonicity and reduce phonon lifetimes. Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature. This work establishes halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes and octahedral distortions as transferable design principles for octahedra-containing halides, spanning both extended frameworks and molecular-cluster motifs, for discovering ultralow-kappa_L materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Fine-Grained Symmetry Inference and Enforcement for Rigorous Crystal Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17176</link><description>arXiv:2602.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Anharmonic Nuclear Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17207</link><description>arXiv:2602.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Orbital current signature using neutron diffraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17311</link><description>arXiv:2602.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Prediction of Dielectric Anisotropy in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17382</link><description>arXiv:2602.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We curate a large-scale dataset of low frequency dielectric anisotropy values for low molecular weight liquid crystals. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that supervised machine-learning models can predict dielectric anisotropy with substantially improved accuracy (RMSE 2.6) compared to estimates obtained from the Maier-Meier relations using molecular properties from both the widely used semiempirical AM1 method (RMSE 9.7) and the modern r2scan-3c composite method (RMSE 11.2).

Abstract: The stability of chemically complex nanoparticles is governed by an immense configurational space arising from heterogeneous local atomic environments across surface and interior regions. Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of Polymer Electrolytes with Bayesian Optimization and High-Throughput Molecular Dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17595</link><description>arXiv:2602.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes are critical for safe, high-energy-density solid-state batteries, yet discovering candidates that balance high ionic conductivity with high transference numbers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to navigate a chemical space of 1.7 million hypothetical polymer electrolyte candidates. Data from previous literature is used to warm-start batch Bayesian optimization for iteratively selecting new polymer electrolytes to evaluate. We iteratively identified, evaluated and analyzed 767 homopolymers as potential candidates. Our results reveal several candidates with transport properties exceeding the benchmark polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI system. Crucially, our optimization campaigns for ionic conductivity and Li-diffusivity demonstrate that branched architectures and ketone functional groups significantly enhance ion-hopping mechanisms within the polymer matrix. We provide an in-depth mechanistic comparison of Li vs. Na cation transport and offer our open-source framework to accelerate the discovery of liquid, gel, and multi-cation electrolyte systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Hamiltonians are Accurate Energy-Force Predictors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16897</link><description>arXiv:2602.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning Hamiltonian (MLH) models have gained traction as fast approximations of electronic structures such as orbitals and electron densities, while also enabling direct evaluation of energies and forces from their predictions. However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17350</link><description>arXiv:2602.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16460</link><description>arXiv:2512.16460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16460v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10382</link><description>arXiv:2601.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10382v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Deep learning generative model for conditional crystal structure prediction of sodium amide</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01994-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 20 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01994-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01994-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deep learning generative model for conditional crystal structure prediction of sodium amide</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01994-2</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] In situ inorganic passivation strategy for high-performance perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00481-7?rss=yes</link><description>Ammonium chromate forms an in situ inorganic passivation layer on perovskite, protecting it from moisture and oxygen.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton-Selective Phonon Coupling in a Lead Halide Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16533</link><description>arXiv:2602.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the optical response of semiconductors, yet disentangling multiple coupling channels in lead halide perovskites remains challenging. We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The rise and fall of an oxide: insights into the phase diagram of bismuth oxide on Au(111)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16552</link><description>arXiv:2602.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth oxide (Bi$_2$O$_3$) is a polymorphic material of considerable technological interest, with applications spanning from heterogeneous catalysis to next-generation nanoelectronics. Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16552v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Addressing Ill-conditioning in Density Functional Theory for Reliable Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16618</link><description>arXiv:2602.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, machine learning (ML) can be used to obtain any electronic property of a many-body system from its electron density within density functional theory. However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Framework for Decomposing Ionic Transport into Interpretable Mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16636</link><description>arXiv:2602.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of ion transport in bulk materials is central to designing next-generation ion conductors for energy storage devices, yet studies employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) have largely been limited to reporting overall transport coefficients without a quantitative, spatiotemporally resolved breakdown of \emph{how} charge is carried. We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MolCrystalFlow: Molecular Crystal Structure Prediction via Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16020</link><description>arXiv:2602.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement learning for path integrals in quantum statistical physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16176</link><description>arXiv:2602.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly finding its way into the field of computational quantum physics. One of the most popular and widely studied approaches in this direction is to use neural networks to model quantum states (NQS) in the Hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics. However, an alternative angle of attack to leverage machine learning in physics is through the path integral formulation, which has so far received far more limited attention. In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16643</link><description>arXiv:2602.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The extensive photo response on metal/n-Si clarified by the zero-gap with inter-band phonon scatterings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18678</link><description>arXiv:2505.18678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UVA to NIR with multi-directional photo responses have been found on metal (Au)/n-Si device. A reasonable explanation has not been found in various physical models of Si-devices for the phenomena. We approached a zero-gap at X (reciprocal point) in two conduction bands of Si to analysis the optical response with the inter-band phonon scatterings. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-$\Gamma$ and X-W successfully simulated the sensitivities in visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the carrier density profile well fitted the response in NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Filling up the zero-gap by doping electrons ($\sim 10^{18}$/cm$^3$) at around X, a lower limit of 0.6 eV arose in the measurement below Si-band gap of 1.17 eV. Indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with phonon scattering, gave a variety of directional photo-responses. The carrier scattering model for the inter bands (X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L) were consistent with the directional dependence of photo-currents under UVA (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.06 eV) excitations. Band to band scatterings assisted to extend the available optical range and increase its variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle, a new frontier will be opened in the photo-conversion system by using indirect-transition semiconductors and thus, it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.18678v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06397</link><description>arXiv:2512.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06397v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] atomSmltr: a modular Python package to simulate laser cooling setups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20596</link><description>arXiv:2511.20596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13194v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Structural insights and predictive screening of ion transport in Li-rich alloys via neuroevolution potentials</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02012-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 19 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02012-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-02012-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Structural insights and predictive screening of ion transport in Li-rich alloys via neuroevolution potentials</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02012-1</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Connecting the concepts of quantum state tomography and molecular representations for machine learning</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00484E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00484E, Perspective&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Raul Ortega Ochoa, Luis Mantilla Calderón, Juan Bernardo Bernardo Perez Sanchez, Mohsen  Bagherimehrab, Abdulrahman Aldossary, Tejs Vegge, Tonio Buonassisi, Alan Aspuru-Guzik&lt;br /&gt;Quantum state tomography has been widely used to reconstruct the quantum state of a system from a set of informationally-complete measurements.

Abstract: The localized states in the band gap of amorphous phase change alloys like Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ control the electrical conduction via the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. Understanding the origin of in-gap states and their evolution in time during aging of the glass is therefore important for the control of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices. Here, we use a machine learning interatomic potential to generate several models of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ whose electronic structure is then analyzed within density functional theory with a hybrid functional. A detailed statistical analysis of the structural motifs on which the in-gap states are localized, reveals that the vast majority of in-gap states involve wrong bonds (homopolar or Ge-Sb bonds) often accompanied by Ge in tetrahedral configurations or overcoordinated Ge and Sb atoms. Metadynamics simulations mimicking glass aging support the picture that structural relaxations lead to the depletion of in-gap states and then to an increase of resistance. The simulations thus provide important insights for the mitigation of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Three-Dimensional Optical-Electrical Simulation of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15759</link><description>arXiv:2602.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a balance among environmental safety and high optoelectronic performance remains challenging. The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model. Overall, this work demonstrates 3D physics-based device engineering as a decisive pathway for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in lead-free double perovskite photovoltaics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15759v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11923</link><description>arXiv:2510.11923v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11923v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-throughput screening and mechanistic insights into solid acid proton conductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15268</link><description>arXiv:2602.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~{\AA} at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A unified theory of feature learning in RNNs and DNNs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15593</link><description>arXiv:2602.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($\mu$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] LEMONS: An open-source platform to generate non-circuLar, anthropometry-based pEdestrian shapes and simulate their Mechanical interactiONS in two dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19865</link><description>arXiv:2508.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library, and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19865v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15046</link><description>arXiv:2508.15046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15046v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous emission of a three-level artificial atom in a one-dimensional open waveguide</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06291</link><description>arXiv:2511.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup - a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06291v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Data-augmented machine learning design and performance-enhancing quaternary synergistic mechanism of novel Cu-Be alloy</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02000-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 18 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02000-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-02000-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Data-augmented machine learning design and performance-enhancing quaternary synergistic mechanism of novel Cu-Be alloy</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-02000-5</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Previous studies have suggested that liquid-like cation motion associated with fast ionic transport can disrupt crystalline symmetry, thereby lifting Raman selection rules. Here, we exploit the resulting low-frequency, diffusive Raman scattering as a spectral signature of fast ionic conduction and develop a machine learning (ML)-accelerated computational pipeline to identify promising solid electrolytes based on this feature. By overcoming the steep computational barriers to calculating Raman spectra of strongly disordered materials at finite temperatures, we achieve near-ab initio accuracy and demonstrate the predictive power of our approach for sodium-ion conductors, revealing clear Raman signatures of liquid-like ion conduction. This work highlights how ML can bridge atomistic simulations and experimental observables, enabling data-efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae411a</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Catalyzed anionic redox in sulfide electrolytes for high-energy all-solid-state organic batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00478-7?rss=yes</link><description>Chemical reactivity at solid-solid interfaces is typically viewed as detrimental in all-solid-state batteries.

Here, we show that a single sulfonium capping layer of dimethyl(phenethyl)sulfonium iodide (DMPESI) simultaneously mitigates both loss pathways, enabling stable operation from bright (1000 lux) to ultra-dim (50 lux) white light-emitting diode illumination. DMPESI-passivated indoor photovoltaic cells exhibit a stabilized power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.8% and an open-circuit voltage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;VOC&lt;/span&gt;) approaching 1 V at 1000 lux, sustain 27.5% PCE at 200 lux, and still deliver 21.9% PCE with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;VOC&lt;/span&gt; ≈ 0.85 V at 50 lux. Across this range, the hysteresis index declines by ≈25%–40%. Transient photovoltage reveals ∼60% longer carrier lifetimes; impedance spectroscopy shows a ≈40% increase in recombination resistance, and capacitance–frequency spectra display a two- to threefold reduction in capacitance at 10 Hz, collectively confirming the simultaneous suppression of trap-assisted recombination and ion migration. An ultrathin sulfonium interlayer (DMPESI) enables stable, low-hysteresis indoor operation across 1000/200/50 lux (IEC TS 62607-7-2:2023). A combined SCLC–IS–KPFM analysis shows a reduction in trap density, suppressed low-frequency ionic response, and a higher perovskite surface work function consistent with enhanced hole extraction. A stabilized 31.8% PCE at 1000 lux is achieved for the 1.6 eV triple-cation CsMAFA-Pb. This approach paves the way for self-powered IoT devices with significantly reduced battery replacement needs, helping to ease the environmental burden of electronic waste.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073304/3380394/Sulfonium-based-passivation-suppresses-trap</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis] Integrating DFT and machine learning for a dual-descriptor strategy in Gold(I) catalyst design: π-bond activation and orbital interactions</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726001016?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 16 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Catalysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Simeng Qi, Ran Fang, Lizi Yang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:57:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726001016</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Machine Learning Discovery of Record‐Low Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Double Perovskites</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202515766?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:40:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202515766</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents] Building Catalyst Exploration Highways by Integrating High‐Throughput and Machine Learning Technologies</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202505497?af=R</link><description>Advanced Energy Materials, Volume 16, Issue 6, 11 February 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:52:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aenm.202505497</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents] Ultrahigh‐Rate Lithium Storage in MoS2 Enabled by Isotropic Ion Transport and Fe‐Atomic Site Conversion</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202505600?af=R</link><description>Advanced Energy Materials, Volume 16, Issue 6, 11 February 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:52:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aenm.202505600</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents] From HF Scavenging to Li‐Ion Transport Enhancement: Multifunctional Separator Enabling Stable Li Metal Batteries in Carbonate‐Based Electrolytes</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202505601?af=R</link><description>Advanced Energy Materials, Volume 16, Issue 6, 11 February 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:52:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aenm.202505601</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents] Water‐Soluble V2O5‐x Enables Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With High Operational and Reverse Bias Stability</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202506005?af=R</link><description>Advanced Energy Materials, Volume 16, Issue 6, 11 February 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:52:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aenm.202506005</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: This study presents an eco-friendly and bio-based symmetric supercapacitor using cotton textile waste-derived hydrogels as electrolytes and chitosan-based carbon electrodes as metal-free charge-storage components. Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evolution of magnetic correlation in doped Hubbard model with altermagnetic spin splitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13643</link><description>arXiv:2602.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(\pi,\pi)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(\pi,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MLIP-MC: A Framework for Adsorption Simulations using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13725</link><description>arXiv:2602.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are essential for screening metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas adsorption, yet their accuracy is limited by underlying interatomic potentials. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), trained on diverse chemical datasets, promise zero-shot prediction without system-specific training. We introduce MLIP-MC, an open-source Python framework to conduct GCMC simulations with MLIPs, and use this framework to benchmark a series of universal models, including MACE-MP-0, ORB-v3, and fairchem ODAC, for CO2 adsorption on ZIF-8, ZIF-4, and Mg-MOF-74. All universal models exhibit systematic biases, consistently over- or underestimating adsorption energetics. Crucially, accuracy depends on training data composition: only models trained on MOF-adsorbate interactions achieve reasonable agreement with a density functional theory derived reference. Errors grow linearly with CO2 uptake, reflecting compounding inaccuracies in adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Our results demonstrate that current universal MLIPs require finetuning for quantitative adsorption predictions and demonstrate the power of MLIP-MC to rapidly test models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning magnetic, lattice, and transport properties in CoNb3S6 via Fe doping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13785</link><description>arXiv:2602.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of Fe doping on the lattice dynamics, magnetic ordering, and magneto-transport properties of the intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets Co1-xFexNb3S6 (x = 0.1 and 0.3). Temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements reveal a pronounced blue shift of the 180 cm-1 phonon mode with increasing Fe concentration, indicating enhanced sensitivity of lattice vibrations to Fe-induced structural and mass effects. While the temperature evolution of the phonon modes is dominated by conventional anharmonic phonon softening, subtle anomalies observed near the N\'eel temperature for x = 0.1 point to weak spin-phonon coupling. Electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility data show clear signatures of the antiferromagnetic phase transitions at TN ~ 20.5-23.7 K for x = 0.1 and TN ~ 32.0 K for x = 0.3. Out-of-plane magnetization measurements reveal hysteretic behavior with two field-induced transitions for x =0.1, which evolve into a single hysteresis loop at x =0.3, signaling a subtle reconstruction of the magnetic ground state. Magneto-transport measurements for x = 0.1 further display a butterfly-shaped hysteretic magnetoresistance and a weak topological Hall effect; however, both features are strongly suppressed at x = 0.3. These results illustrate the critical role of Fe-induced magnetic structure reconstruction in fine-tuning topological and magnetic transport phenomena in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-integrated Multiscale Simulation Framework: Bridging Scales in Associative Polymer-Colloid Suspensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13911</link><description>arXiv:2602.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the rheological behavior of associative polymers bridging colloidal particles into transient networks is fundamentally challenging because the coupled spatiotemporal scales prevent efficient molecular-fidelity modeling. We address this through a novel, unified multiscale simulation framework for telechelic polymer-colloid suspensions integrating: explicit-chain Brownian dynamics resolving polymer-particle association kinetics; active learning metamodels compressing kinetics into efficient surrogates; and Population Balance-Brownian Dynamics (Pop-BD) computing network-scale dynamics from metamodel predictions. Validated against explicit-chain Brownian dynamics, our framework accurately reproduces time-and frequency-dependent stress relaxation moduli, enabling simulations of larger systems over longer timescales. Systematic investigations reveal that network connectivity exhibits critical transitions at specific chain-to-particle ratios, with bond density and lifetime correlating to enhanced relaxation times and moduli. Higher particle volume fractions yield more persistent bonds and slower relaxation. This framework connects chain-level dynamics to macroscopic rheology, enabling computationally efficient rational design of associative colloidal materials for waterborne coatings and soft-matter applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polymer Brushes and Grafted Polymers: AI/ML-Driven Synthesis, Simulation, and Characterization towards autonomous SDL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14362</link><description>arXiv:2602.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer brushes and grafted polymers have attracted significant interest at the intersection of polymers, interfacial chemistry, colloidal science, and nanostructuring. The confinement of high-density grafted polymers and differences in swelling regimes govern the synthetic challenges and the interesting physics underlying their macromolecular dynamics. In this article, we focus on another intersection, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and how workflows will enhance the microstructure and composition of these systems. It will also accelerate potential applications through high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and data-driven intelligence, enabling scientific discovery and optimization. Applications in microfluidics, sensors, bioimplants, drug delivery, and related areas may yet offer more opportunities for ML-driven optimization. There is also interest in applying these studies with self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that can leverage autonomous systems for synthesis screening, characterization, and application evaluation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] M-CODE: Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14384</link><description>arXiv:2602.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in materials science requires data standards and data management practices that can capture the complexity of real-world structures, including surfaces, interfaces, defects, and dimensionality reduction. We present M-CODE - Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution - a compact categorization system that links materials-science-specific terminology to a set of reusable concepts as building blocks and provenance-aware transformations. M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Realization of a Synthetic Hall Torus with a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14549</link><description>arXiv:2602.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a synthetic Hall torus using a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring-shaped trap with in situ imaging. By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology. Our results establish a versatile platform for investigating quantum Hall physics and topological phenomena in synthetic curved spaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DFT and MLIP study of solute segregation to coherent and semi-coherent {\alpha}-Fe/Fe$_3$C interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14603</link><description>arXiv:2602.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $\alpha$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied in materials science, yet their predictive power is often constrained by data scarcity. Here, we show that accurate predictions can be achieved, even with a limited number of training examples, provided the dataset is compact and and grounded in physically relevant quantities. By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast and accurate quasi-atom method for simultaneous atomistic and continuum simulation of solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14867</link><description>arXiv:2602.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel hybrid method of simultaneous atomistic simulation of solids in critical regions (contacts surfaces, cracks areas, etc.), along with continuum modeling of other parts. The continuum is treated in terms of quasi-atoms of different size, comprising composite medium. The parameters of interaction potential between the quasi-atoms are optimized to match elastic properties of the composite medium to those of the atomic one. The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method. We demonstrate a significant superiority of our approach in computational speed and implementation convenience. Finally, we discuss a possible extension of the method for modeling other phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14867v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement in quantum spin chains is strictly finite at any temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13386</link><description>arXiv:2602.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15029</link><description>arXiv:2602.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15753</link><description>arXiv:2508.15753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While high-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the standard for analyzing stress distributions and material deformation, it is computationally intensive and often ill-suited for the rapid exploration of vast kinematic configuration spaces. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, a lightweight, open-source Python framework for the efficient deployment simulation of kirigami structures. Unlike continuum mechanics solvers, PyKirigami models tessellations as articulated rigid-body networks, allowing for the real-time simulation of global deployment trajectories and volumetric transformations. The tool incorporates collision detection and interactive actuation, enabling users to validate folding paths and identify geometric locking states in both 2D and 3D topologies. This framework serves as a fast kinematic prototyping tool for kirigami structures, allowing researchers to verify deployment mechanics and self-contacts prior to performing detailed mechanical analysis or physical fabrication.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15753v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Massive Discovery of Low-Dimensional Materials from Universal Computational Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20164</link><description>arXiv:2509.20164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 887 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20164v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link><description>arXiv:2602.03546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03546v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-Dimensional Limit of Stochastic Gradient Flow via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06320</link><description>arXiv:2602.06320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06320v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12242</link><description>arXiv:2602.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12242v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Nano Energy] Bulk doping and grain boundary engineering of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte for wide-temperature, external-pressure-free all-solid-state sodium batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285526001138?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 16 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Nano Energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Hongyi Liao, Huaguang Ma, Congcong Liu, Yu Yao, Wubin Du, Zhijun Wu, Hongge Pan, Yang Yang, Xianhong Rui, Yan Yu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Nano Energy</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:03:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285526001138</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: The frictionless motion of an object through a fluid medium is commonly viewed as a hallmark of superfluidity. According to Landau, kinematic constraints prohibit superfluid behavior in one-dimensional (1D) bosonic systems. Here, using ultracold atoms, we show how a microscopic impurity can propagate through a strongly interacting 1D Bose gas without any friction, at odds with conventional expectations. We inject the impurity with initial velocities ranging from the subsonic to supersonic regime, and subsequently track its dynamics. For supersonic initial velocities, we observe the formation of a shock wave and a remarkably fast relaxation to a stationary regime, on a time scale that increases with decreasing impurity velocity. After reaching the stationary state, the impurity continues its motion through the system with a finite velocity. Our findings demonstrate how quantum effects can conspire to eliminate dissipation of a microscopic object immersed in a quantum fluid, thereby bringing novel insights into the propagation of matter and information in the quantum realm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Transformer-based Model for Rapid Microstructure Inference from Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12420</link><description>arXiv:2602.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12737</link><description>arXiv:2602.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moir\'e potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moir\'e potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Wetting and Optical Properties of CuAg Alloys via Surface Texture Morphology Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12848</link><description>arXiv:2602.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-silver (CuAg) alloys are increasingly explored for applications in high-performance electrical and electronic systems, owing to their unique combination of high electrical and thermal conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of how these alloys surface characteristics fundamentally influence properties remains largely underdeveloped. Here, we explored the complex interplay between surface texture morphology, layer composition, wetting, and optical properties of Cu, Ag, and CuAg thin films deposited on textured silicon substrates via magnetron sputtering. Employing data mining and machine learning techniques, we identified robust correlations between contact angle and surface fractal dimension across all layer types promoting Cassie-Baxter surface state formation. Our analysis revealed a significant connection between layer thickness and surface topography entropy deficit, suggesting a dynamic evolution of surface order/disorder during metal film growth. Furthermore, we observed that contact angle sensitivity to layer thickness implied a correlation with microstructure evolution. Through K-Means clustering, we successfully categorized the formed surface textures morphology. Finally, a Random Forest regression model was developed to accurately predict water contact angles (Mean Absolute Error around 5 deg) using only texture and optical parameters. The model, along with accompanying Python code, is publicly available. Our findings establish a pathway towards targeted surface texture morphology engineering for tailored material performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12848v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-Tc Superconductivity in Functionalized Out-of-Plane Ordered Double Transition Metal MXenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12960</link><description>arXiv:2602.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors attracted growing interest in condensed-matter physics research. In this work, we explore the superconducting properties of surface-functionalized, out-of-plane ordered double transition-metal MXenes (o-MXenes), which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic characteristics. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC), anharmonicity, and anisotropy effect in superconductivity properties of o-MXenes. We examine a wide range of o-MXene systems, M$_{2}$M$^\prime$X$_{2}$T$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; M$^\prime$ = Sc, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Nb, Ta; X = C, N), functionalized with F, O, Cl, and H groups. Out of 128 candidates, 32 compounds are found to be mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures (T$_{c}$) from 0.1 K to 52 K. Notably, the Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ compound achieves the highest T$_{c}$ of 52 K, with a superconducting gap of $\sim$10 meV. Solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equation reveals that Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ is an anisotropic two-gap superconductor, and incorporating anharmonic effects decreases its T$_{c}$ slightly. We further analyze flat-band-induced EPC enhancement and present EPC matrix elements as functions of phonon wavevector q for distinct vibrational modes that show anharmonic behavior of these materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topology of the Fermi surface and universality of the metal-metal and metal-insulator transitions: $d$-dimensional Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as an example</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13050</link><description>arXiv:2602.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13050v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nuclear gradients from auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo and their application in geometry optimization and transition state search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13187</link><description>arXiv:2602.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a method for computing accurate and scalable nuclear forces within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework. Our approach leverages automatic differentiation of the energy functional to obtain nuclear gradients at a computational cost comparable to that of energy evaluation. The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13194</link><description>arXiv:2602.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17576</link><description>arXiv:2507.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17576v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link><description>arXiv:2602.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on SrTiO$_3$ are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07747v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Incongruent melting and phase diagram of SiC from machine learning molecular dynamics</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01976-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 16 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01976-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01976-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Incongruent melting and phase diagram of SiC from machine learning molecular dynamics</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01976-4</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Energy] Charge and slip-length optimization in lipid-bilayer-coated nanofluidics for enhanced osmotic energy harvesting</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-026-01976-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Energy, Published online: 16 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-026-01976-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41560-026-01976-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Salinity gradients can be converted into electrical energy via charge-selective membranes.

To address this, we developed a head-fixed locomotor paradigm that decouples the speed- and leg loading-related effects on gait by combining optogenetic stimulation in the cuneiform nucleus with head height and surface slope modulation. This approach revealed a largely speed-independent shift in homolateral phase preference from strict alternation to a quarter-of-phase more synchronised coordination upon a rearward redistribution of load.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00383-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Ultra-stretchable superomniphobic surfaces via machine-learning-guided laser ablation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00653-8?rss=yes</link><description>We developed a simple, scalable, and solvent-free CO2 laser ablation technique to fabricate ultra-stretchable superomniphobic surfaces. Since laser-material interactions are highly complex, we used a machine learning framework to identify the optimal laser ablation conditions without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. The resulting surfaces can retain superomniphobicity in multiple deformation modes, including 400% strain and 5,000+ stretch-release cycles.</description><author>Matter</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00653-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Scientific knowledge graph and ontology generation using open large language models</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00275C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00275C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00275C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alexandru Oarga, Matthew Hart, Andres M.

Abstract: We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient molecular dynamics simulation of 2D penta-silicene materials using machine learning potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11548</link><description>arXiv:2602.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are a modern computational method that allows achieving near-quantum mechanical accuracy (DFT) while still describing large-scale systems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we use MLIP from DeepMD package and the classical Tersoff potential for SiC (Tersoff.SiC potential) to fully and accurately describe atomic interactions and apply them to molecular dynamics simulations of penta silicene sheet. The results show that the melting points (T$_g$) temperatures of the system in the canonical NVT and isobaric NPT sets are 632 K and 606 K, while the Tersoff.SiC potential have the high melting points, respectively. In addition, the radial distribution function exhibits characteristic peaks at interatomic distances of 2.275 \AA \text{} and 2.375 \AA, while the Tersoff.SiC potential only describe distance of 2.375 \AA. Furthermore, penta silicene was also simulated using on-the-fly machine learning for 10 ps to evaluate the structural stability of the system. This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional penta silicene sheets with pentagonal structures using a high-precision, cost-effective method, contributing further evidence to support experimental synthesis and opening up potential future applications of this material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coupling Lattice Distortion and Cation Disorder to Control Li-ion Transport in Cation-Disordered Rocksalt Oxides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11579</link><description>arXiv:2602.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cation-disordered solids offer a rich chemical landscape where local coordination, lattice responses, and configurational disorder collectively, yet often implicitly, govern ion transport. In cation-disordered rocksalt oxides, Li+ diffusion has conventionally been rationalized by the static 0-transition-metal (0-TM) percolation rule, which assumes an ideal, passive lattice and thus fails to capture experimentally accessible capacities. Here, we show that lattice distortion is an essential, previously overlooked degree of freedom that actively reshapes Li+ percolation networks. By developing a lattice-responsive framework combining Monte Carlo sampling of cation configurations with machine-learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, we quantitatively predict Li+ percolation and electrochemical capacities within 5% of experiment. Our results reveal a causal coupling between lattice distortion and cation short-range order: enhanced local distortions precede and suppress short-range ordering, activating Li+ migration through nominally inaccessible 1-TM channels, fundamentally extending percolation beyond the 0-TM paradigm. Guided by this, we design and synthesize a high-entropy oxide, Li1.2Mn0.2Ti0.2V0.2Mo0.2O2, which exhibits enhanced distortion and achieves a 71.9% Li+ percolation network, surpassing 65.8% in Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2, delivering 256.3 mAh/g capacity, closely matching our prediction of 255.1 mAh/g. These findings establish lattice distortion as an active control parameter for ion transport, revising percolation concepts and offering a general design principle beyond metal-ion cathodes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rust-accelerated powder X-ray diffraction simulation for high-throughput and machine-learning-driven materials science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11709</link><description>arXiv:2602.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulations are a key prerequisite for generating large datasets used in the development of machine-learning models for XRD-based materials analysis. However, the widely used pymatgen powder XRD calculator, implemented entirely in Python, can be computationally inefficient for large-scale workloads, limiting throughput. We present XRD-Rust, a Rust-accelerated implementation of the pymatgen powder XRD calculator that maintains full compatibility with existing Python-based workflows. The method retains pymatgen for crystal structure handling and symmetry analysis while reimplementing the computationally intensive parts of the XRD calculation in Rust. Performance benchmarks were carried out on large crystallographic datasets from the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional Structure Database (MC3D, 33 142 structures) and the Crystallography Open Database (COD 515 181). For the MC3D dataset, XRD-Rust achieves an average speedup of 4.7 +- 1.6 and a maximum speedup of 25, reducing computation from 34.9 s to 1.4 s. For the COD dataset, the average speedup is 6.1 +- 4.6 with a maximum speedup of 719 (1437 min to 2 min).

Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link><description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetopological mechanics in Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12168</link><description>arXiv:2602.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Second excited state of ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ tetramer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12225</link><description>arXiv:2602.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12225v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11194</link><description>arXiv:2602.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link><description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12242</link><description>arXiv:2602.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10789</link><description>arXiv:2602.10789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10789v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475</link><description>arXiv:2504.06475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.06475v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] GraphSLA: Graph machine learning for predicting small molecule - lncRNA associations</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000119?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry, Volume 3, Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ashish Panghalia, Parth Kumar, Vikram Singh&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000119</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Machine learning-guided synthesis of prospective organic molecular materials: An algorithm with latent variables for understanding and predicting experimentally unobservable reactions</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000132?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry, Volume 3, Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Kazuhiro Takeda, Naoya Ohtsuka, Toshiyasu Suzuki, Norie Momiyama&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000132</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Neural networks for neurocomputing circuits: A computational study of tolerance to noise and activation function non-uniformity when machine learning materials properties</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000168?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry, Volume 3, Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ye min Thant, Methawee Nukunudompanich, Chu-Chen Chueh, Manabu Ihara, Sergei Manzhos&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000168</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Electrostatic map for the hydration-induced frequency shifts of the NH stretching mode of peptide constructed using some machine learning models</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000156?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry, Volume 3, Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Hajime Torii, Mikito Tsujimoto, Yukichi Kitamura&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000156</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Comparative study of machine learning methods for accurate prediction of logP and pKb</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000181?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry, Volume 4, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Juda Baikété, Alhadji Malloum, Jeanet Conradie&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000181</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] AI-assisted quantitative deciphering of molecular configuration and steric effects for high-performance zinc battery electrolytes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-026-01100-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 13 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-026-01100-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s43246-026-01100-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Zinc‑ion battery performance depends on the molecular design of electrolyte additives, but the effects of molecular structure and steric factors on solvation behavior remain unquantified.

This work leverages density functional theory and machine-learning interatomic potentials to investigate and compare the phonon thermal transport and electrochemical properties of lithiated graphene monolayers and graphene–copper (Cu) heterostructures. The graphene–Cu heterostructure exhibits significantly reduced thermal conductivity compared to the graphene monolayer, originating from decreased phonon group velocities, shortened phonon lifetimes, increased anharmonicity as well as scattering phase space due to interlayer coupling. However, the diffusion energy barrier of Li ions over the graphene monolayer (0.3 eV) drops to 0.24 eV on the graphene top surface of the heterostructure and the Cu bottom surface has a substantially lower barrier of 0.04 eV, indicating enhanced electrochemical performance facilitated by strengthened adsorption energies. Additionally, lithiation further suppresses the thermal conductivity of the graphene monolayers and the graphene–Cu heterostructures with the top surface of the lithiated heterostructure depicts higher thermal conductivity than the bottom surface. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between electrochemical enhancement and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing atomistic insights and design guidelines for optimizing graphene-based anodes and current–collector interfaces in next-generation LIBs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/062203/3380044/Phonon-transport-in-lithiated-graphene-copper</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] An Effective Screening Method of CO2 Adsorption and Selectivity for Metal–Organic Frameworks by Machine Learning and High-Throughput Computation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06490</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06490/asset/images/medium/jp5c06490_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06490&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 19:28:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06490</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] n-Mode Quantized Anharmonic Vibronic Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State Dynamics</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c02014</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c02014/asset/images/medium/ct5c02014_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c02014&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 19:05:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c02014</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Statistical comparison and uncertainty analysis of graph neural networks and machine learning models for molecular property prediction in drug discovery</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294974772500020X?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;

Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of ion availability and mobility in the loss of cation selectivity for CaCl\textsubscript{2} in negatively charged nanopores: molecular dynamics using scaled-charge models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10600</link><description>arXiv:2602.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10789</link><description>arXiv:2602.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10789v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Scale Analysis of the Electrostatics of Dielectric Crystals: Emergence of Polarization Density and Boundary Charges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10927</link><description>arXiv:2602.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic crystals, such as solid electrolytes and complex oxides, are central to modern technologies for energy storage, sensing, actuation, and other functional applications. An important fundamental issue in the atomic and quantum-scale modeling of these materials is defining the macroscopic polarization. In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell.
  We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Annotated digital image correlation displacement fields from fatigue crack growth experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10930</link><description>arXiv:2602.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a curated dataset of planar displacement fields from eight fatigue crack growth experiments obtained via full-field digital image correlation (DIC). The dataset covers multiple aerospace-grade aluminium alloys, specimen geometries, material orientations, and load configurations, providing a diverse experimental basis for data-driven fracture mechanics research. Crack tip locations are consistently annotated using an iterative correction procedure applied to all measurements, and fracture mechanical descriptors like stress-intensity factors are provided as additional labels. The dataset comprises 8,794 unique experimentally observed displacement fields and a total of 70,352 supervised samples generated through standardized interpolation and augmentation. DIC data is provided as uniformly interpolated displacement grids at three standardized resolutions 28 x 28, 64 x 64, and 128 x 128 pixels, each available in three dataset sizes to support scalable use cases ranging from educational applications to high-capacity model development. Accompanying metadata and a Python interface facilitate filtering, loading, and integration into reproducible machine learning and fracture mechanics workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning: a physical perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11071</link><description>arXiv:2602.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning (ML) is receiving increasing attention for achieving quantum-mechanical accuracy in predicting a wide range of molecular and material properties. However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11071v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From Natural Language to Materials Discovery:The Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11123</link><description>arXiv:2602.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D &gt; 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19594</link><description>arXiv:2406.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration and degradation. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modifications of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.19594v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10757</link><description>arXiv:2503.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement and control of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Moreover, we show that coherent displacive phononic excitations in tandem with electron-phonon coupling is a pathway to dynamically control phonon anharmonicity. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.10757v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in Kagome metals near van Hove singularities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234</link><description>arXiv:2510.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently-discovered family of Kagome metals has attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic loop-current bond order (NLCBO) that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Examining an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point, we find that frustration of the complex order-parameter phases leads to NLCBO. We further present conditions for overcoming other competing phases, including isotropic charge-bond and loop-current orders. Applying our findings to a previously studied model for $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$, we find that NLCBO emerges within a small region of phase space within mean-field theory.

Abstract: When multiple degrees of freedom share similar energy scales in quantum materials, intertwined electronic orders, which exhibit broken symmetries, are often strongly coupled. Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11341v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link><description>arXiv:2602.06987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06987v3</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Materials: Table of Contents] A Paradigm Shift in Anode‐Free Lithium Metal Battery: Pressure‐Activated Solid‐State Interfaces for High‐Rate Desolvated Cation Diffusion</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202518037?af=R</link><description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:34:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adma.202518037</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125003769?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 17 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Joule, Volume 9, Issue 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Do-Hyeon Kim, Young-Han Lee, Jeong-Myeong Yoon, Pugalenthiyar Thondaiman, Byung Chul Kim, In-Chul Choi, Jeong-Hee Choi, Ki-Joon Jeon, Cheol-Min Park&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Joule</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:07:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125003769</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Joule] Machine learning-driven interface material design for high-performance perovskite solar cells with scalability and band-gap universality</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125004453?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 23 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Joule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Chenyang Zhang, Yuteng Jia, Bingqian Zhang, Qiangqiang Zhao, Ruida Xu, Shuping Pang, Han Wang, Stefaan De Wolf, Kai Wang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Joule</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:07:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125004453</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Joule] Boosting ionic conductivity of fluoride electrolytes by polyanion coordination chemistry enabling 5 V-Class all-solid-state batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125004143?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 21 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Joule, Volume 10, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Huaimin Jin, Xingyu Wang, Simeng Zhang, Xiangzhen Zhu, Chong Liu, Junyi Yue, Jie Qu, Bei Wu, Xu Han, Yueyue Wang, Yang Xu, Han Wu, Liyu Zhou, Mingying Zhang, Hao Lai, Shuo Wang, Jianwen Liang, Xueliang Sun, Xiaona Li&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Joule</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:07:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435125004143</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Nonetheless, intrinsic perovskite imperfections, caused by lattice strain and phase segregation, severely hindered the urgent advancement of efficient WBG-PSCs. These imperfections lead to detrimental non-radiative recombination, which limits device performance and accelerates device degradation. In this study, we incorporated 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide into the perovskite surface, effectively mitigating residual strain and suppressing phase separation. Through this synergy, the device effectively suppresses the formation of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inactive phases, minimizes interfacial defect generation, and enhances both carrier lifetime and transport properties. Consequently, we developed the WBG-PSCs with a bandgap of 1.66 eV, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% with a high open-circuit voltage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.23 V. More importantly, these unencapsulated devices demonstrated excellent environmental stability, maintaining 90.25% of their initial PCE after 1500 h in an atmospheric environment with 35% relative humidity. This study provides a simple and effective strategy to improve the efficiency and stability of WBG-PSCs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061603/3379900/Lattice-strain-conversion-suppresses-ion-migration</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Quantitative virus infectivity titration and dose response analyses using cell-culture based methods and python code assisted data analysis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00393-7?rss=yes</link><description>Enteroviruses cause large impact on public health worldwide.

Consequently, their wide-bandgap variants (1.65–2.0 eV) are particularly well-suited for use as top cells in tandem solar cell configurations. However, their development remains hindered by certain challenges, such as halide segregation and high defect density. While previous reviews have summarized advances in this field, there is a lack of a comprehensive discussion that spans from challenges to development and applications. This article, from the perspectives of material and process optimization, specifically focuses on the latest breakthroughs achieved over the past year. It systematically outlines strategies, including additive engineering, crystallization kinetics regulation, and interface engineering, to realize defect passivation, film quality improvement, and device performance enhancement. This review not only delves into the mechanistic understanding of halide segregation but also analyzes recent research progress on the integration of wide-bandgap perovskite top cells with various bottom cells, such as copper indium gallium selenide, silicon, narrow-bandgap perovskites, and organic solar cells. Finally, it highlights future research directions, emphasizing that addressing the intrinsic stability of materials and clarifying the microscopic mechanisms of phase segregation are crucial for advancing their industrial applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Energy Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/4/1/011501/3379365/Developing-wide-bandgap-perovskites-for-tandem</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 &lt; x &lt; 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09727</link><description>arXiv:2602.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Gr\"uneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MoireStudio: A Universal Twisted Electronic Structure Calculation Package</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09739</link><description>arXiv:2602.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics is an emerging and captivating field in condensed matter physics and material science. However, accurately and efficiently calculating the electronic structures of twisted systems remains a significant challenge. To address this, we have developed MoireStudio, a universal Python-based computational package for twisted electronic structures. Its functionalities include commensurate structure search, structure generation, parameterization, and construction for tight-binding models and continuum models, and the precise incorporation of full relaxation effects. The package is applicable to arbitrary combinations of two-dimensional materials, including rectangular lattices and heterostructures. User-friendly and easy to use, MoireStudio supports parallel large-scale computations, provides visualization capabilities, and offers interfaces with third-party software. It is poised to become a convenient and powerful tool for researchers in twistronics fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09739v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moir\'e Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09938</link><description>arXiv:2602.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moir\'e materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PySlice: Routine Vibrational Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Prediction with Universal Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10064</link><description>arXiv:2602.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope can reveal phonon excitations with nanometer spatial resolution, yet routine prediction remains out of reach due to fragmented workflows requiring specialized expertise. Here we introduce PySlice, the first publicly available implementation of the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunction (TACAW) method, providing an automated framework that produces momentum- and energy-resolved vibrational electron energy-loss spectra directly from atomic structures. By integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials with TACAW, PySlice eliminates the bottleneck of per-system potential development. Users input atomic structures and obtain phonon dispersions, spectral diffraction patterns, and spectrum images through a unified workflow spanning molecular dynamics, GPU-accelerated electron scattering, and frequency-domain analysis. We outline the formulation behind the code, demonstrate its application to canonical systems in materials science, and discuss its use for advanced analysis and materials exploration. The modular Python architecture additionally supports conventional electron microscopy simulations, providing a general-purpose platform for imaging and diffraction calculations. PySlice makes vibrational spectroscopy prediction routine rather than specialized, enabling computational screening for experimental design, systematic exploration of phonon physics across materials families, and high-throughput generation of simulated data for training of future machine learning models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11100</link><description>arXiv:2503.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.11100v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link><description>arXiv:2506.19915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19915v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Screening novel cathode materials from the Energy-GNoME database using MACE machine learning force field and DFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22504</link><description>arXiv:2511.22504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we employ a multi-fidelity screening protocol combining the Energy-GNoME confident criteria, foundational MACE machine-learning force fields (MLFF), and physically motivated heuristic filters to identify novel intercalation cathodes for post-lithium batteries, namely: Na-, K-, Mg-, and Ca-ion batteries. Foundational MACE models are used to efficiently asses dynamical stability, thermodynamical stability, average voltage, and theoretical specific energy, enabling a rapid screening of candidates. For the most promising cathodes, voltage predictions are refined using DFT+U calculations. This work delivers three key outcomes: i) establishing and validating a robust high-throughput screening approach for cathode materials with foundational MLFF models; ii) suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation of batteries; iii) a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy-GNoME database on the examined materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22504v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01859</link><description>arXiv:2602.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01859v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link><description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link><description>arXiv:2602.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways.

Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07543v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Solid State Ionics] Research on casting technology and properties of LLZTO solid electrolytes</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167273826000317?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 1 April 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Solid State Ionics, Volume 438&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Zhen Ma, Runqing Yao, Dongmei Liu, Longrong Yao, Changyun Li, Xuliang Zhao, Yang Li&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Solid State Ionics</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 02:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167273826000317</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Genetic regulation of methylation across East Asian and European populations</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69372-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 11 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69372-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69372-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Here the authors identify via an East Asian mQTL study (n = 7,619) nearly 29,000 novel mCpG.

Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AtomMOF: All-Atom Flow Matching for MOF-Adsorbate Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07351</link><description>arXiv:2602.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have shown promise for modeling metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but existing approaches (1) rely on coarse-grained representations that assume fixed bond lengths and angles, and (2) neglect the MOF-adsorbate interactions, which are critical for downstream applications. We introduce AtomMOF, a scalable flow-based model built on an all-atom Diffusion Transformer that maps 2D molecular graphs of building blocks and adsorbates directly to equilibrium 3D structures without imposing structural constraints. We further present scaling laws for porous crystal generation, indicating predictable performance gains with increased model capacity, and introduce Feynman-Kac steering guided by machine-learned interatomic potentials to improve geometric validity and sampling stability. On the (MOF-only) BW dataset, AtomMOF increases the match rate by 35.00% and reduces RMSD by 32.64%. On the ODAC25 dataset (MOF-adsorbate), AtomMOF is substantially more sample-efficient than grand canonical Monte Carlo in recovering adsorption configurations and can identify candidates with lower adsorption energies than the reference dataset.

Abstract: This paper introduces ELAS3D-Xtal, a high-performance Fortran/OpenMP upgrade of the NIST ELAS3D voxel-based finite element solver for computing 3D elastic fields in polycrystals with defects. The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link><description>arXiv:2602.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CDW Gap Collapse and Weyl State Restoration in (TaSe4)2I via Coherent Phonons: A First-Principles Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07897</link><description>arXiv:2602.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent phonon excitation offers a nonthermal route to control quantum phases of condensed matter. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon landscape of (TaSe4)2I in its charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. We identify nine symmetry-preserving Raman-active modes that can suppress the Gamma-Z direct gap to the meV scale and render the system globally gapless by generating Weyl nodes at generic k points. Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime. Our results provide predictive insight for ultrafast pump-probe experiments and present a generalizable framework for lattice-driven topological switching in quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic cross-modal learning for experimental NMR-based structure elucidation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08752</link><description>arXiv:2602.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, natural product characterization, and metabolomics, yet its interpretation remains heavily dependent on expert knowledge and difficult to scale. Although machine learning has been applied to NMR spectrum prediction, library retrieval, and structure generation, these tasks have evolved in isolation using simulated data and incompatible spectral representations, limiting their utility under real experimental scenarios.Here we present NMRPeak, a unified cross-modal learning system that integrates these three tasks through experimentally grounded design. We curate approximately 1.8 million experimental and simulated spectra to construct the largest benchmark for NMR-based structure elucidation and systematically quantify the distribution shift between these domains. We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation. These capabilities establish a foundation for automated, high-throughput molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DISCOVER: A Physics-Informed, GPU-Accelerated Symbolic Regression Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06986</link><description>arXiv:2602.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link><description>arXiv:2602.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient, Equivariant Predictions of Distributed Charge Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07234</link><description>arXiv:2602.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or {\sigma}-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MSP-LLM: A Unified Large Language Model Framework for Complete Material Synthesis Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07543</link><description>arXiv:2602.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] dewi-kadita: A Python Library for Idealized Fish Schooling Simulation with Entropy-Based Diagnostics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07948</link><description>arXiv:2602.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P &lt; 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools. The library addresses the need for standardized, reproducible infrastructure in collective behavior modeling analogous to established molecular dynamics codes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cutting Through the Noise: On-the-fly Outlier Detection for Robust Training of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08849</link><description>arXiv:2602.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermi-liquid transport beyond the upper critical field in superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19011</link><description>arXiv:2505.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a highly renormalized Fermi liquid or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates, superconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ exceeding 80 and 40~K has been respectively realised in pressurized bulk crystals and epitaxially strained thin films. These advancements call for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters in these new materials platforms of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64~T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300~K. We find that the normal state of thin-film LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi-liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state therein. Our results demonstrate that thin-film LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}$ scaling observed across a myriad of strongly correlated superconductors and establish key normal-state characteristics of strained bilayer superconducting nickelates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19011v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electron-phonon couplings in polymorphous crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09673</link><description>arXiv:2506.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to locally disordered unit cells that, on average, reproduce the high-symmetry structures observed in diffraction experiments. Standard theories of electron-phonon interactions fail to describe the temperature-dependent electronic structure of such polymorphous systems. Hybrid halide perovskites are a prime example, where configurational entropy from both polymorphism and molecular disorder plays a central role. Here we generalize the special displacement method to polymorphous crystals, providing an efficient ab initio framework for electron-phonon couplings without resorting to molecular dynamics. We resolve long-standing discrepancies in hybrid halide perovskite physics, including temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons and band gaps. Our approach provides a practical route to link local disorder, configurational entropy, and electron-phonon interactions, with applicability across diverse material classes, from optoelectronics and ferroelectrics to thermoelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.09673v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Roadmap for electronic structure, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon calculations in locally disordered inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10402</link><description>arXiv:2506.10402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10402v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Periodically forced pinned anharmonic atom chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11319</link><description>arXiv:2507.11319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works proved a hydrodynamic limit for periodically forced atom chains with harmonic interaction and pinning, together with momentum flip. When energy is the only conserved quantity, one would expect similar results in the anharmonic case, as conjectured for the temperature profile and energy flux in arXiv:2212.00093. However, outside the harmonic case, explicit computations are generally no longer possible, thus making a rigorous proof of this hydrodynamic limit difficult. Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this limit for the particular case of a chain with $\beta$-FPUT interactions and harmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the conjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type formula for the limiting energy current conjectured in arXiv:2212.00093 are correct. We then use this Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the energy current and period of the forcing. This relationship is investigated in the case of significant rate of momentum flip, small rate of momentum flip and no momentum flip. We compare the relationship observed in the anharmonic case to that of the harmonic case for which explicit formulae are available.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.11319v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for systems with extended covalent networks and van der Waals interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14306</link><description>arXiv:2508.14306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged as a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14306v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for large-scale optoelectronic property prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20536</link><description>arXiv:2508.20536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20536v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22592</link><description>arXiv:2511.22592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity.

Abstract: Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Additionally, classification models using both random forests and Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated to distinguish between large and small particles. While random forests show moderate performance, LLMs offer no significant advantages under data-scarce conditions. Overall, this study demonstrates that carefully curated small data sets, paired with robust classical ML, can effectively predict the synthesis of Cu NPs and highlights that for lab-scale studies, complex models like LLMs may offer limited benefit over simpler techniques.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16545v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An exciting approach to theoretical spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11388</link><description>arXiv:2601.11388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital (LAPW+LO) basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT). Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, and many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Moreover, exciting can handle resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC). Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning (ML). All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientifically relevant materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11388v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moir\'e heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06656</link><description>arXiv:2602.06656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06656v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning of spatial densities in inhomogeneous correlated quantum systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09050</link><description>arXiv:2211.09050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has made important headway in helping to improve the treatment of quantum many-body systems. A domain of particular relevance are correlated inhomogeneous systems. What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2211.09050v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-color harmonic spectroscopy of ultrafast Dirac electron dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24290</link><description>arXiv:2505.24290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high-harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report a similar effect, pronounced ultrafast carrier saturation dynamics and harmonic emission suppression during nonperturbative harmonic generation (NPHG) in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports NPHG at laser intensities as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Ultrafast carrier saturation strongly modulates the interplay between interband and intraband currents, a key characteristic of NPHG in Dirac materials. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. The excitation of out-of-equilibrium hot carriers and the concomitant saturation near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our finding reveal that field-driven carrier saturation plays a critical role in gapless solid NPHG. We demonstrate the potential of NPHG and HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering novel opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24290v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Circuit Fidelity in Transmon Qubit Rings via Operation Duration Tuning under Strong Connectivity Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08267</link><description>arXiv:2511.08267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, yet they face significant fidelity degradation due to connectivity noise, particularly in the intermediate coupling regime where noise levels are substantial. While prior works suggest that high fidelity requires operating in regimes with strongly suppressed noise, maintaining such conditions under practical experimental constraints remains challenging. To address this, we investigate quantum gate operations in fully connected transmon rings, examining both SWAP and general circuits. Our study reveals that fidelity can be significantly enhanced by tuning gate operation durations, with local maxima emerging even under strong noise conditions. These fidelity enhancements occur consistently across different qubit numbers and operation types, and for specific initial states -- particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement properties -- the achieved fidelities approach quantum error correction thresholds. Furthermore, we develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts the optimal operation durations for new devices, enabling efficient optimization without extensive experimental simulations. These results provide a pathway toward robust quantum circuit design in noisy experimental environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08267v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06065</link><description>arXiv:2602.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions.

Here, we report epitaxial growth of vanadium oxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) thin films on sapphire substrates using the reactive gas pulsing technique (RGPT) in conjunction with intense plasma activation facilitated by asymmetric bipolar pulse DC (ABPDC) sputtering. The deposition methodology followed in this work utilizes growth temperature as low as 275 °C as opposed to the substantially higher temperatures (&amp;gt;500 °C) reported in previous works. The process also avoids any post-processing of the films including annealing. The films deposited in RGPT mode show good environmental stability over a long time range using a simple deposition methodology without placing any top barrier layers to stop ageing. Investigation of the semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT) behavior reveals a very sharp reversible first-order phase transition with sharpness ∼2 °C (very close to bulk single crystals) and switching ratio of ∼1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; achieved with the RGPT mode.

Abstract: Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $\kappa(\delta)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $\delta$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(\pi,\pi)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $\omega=0$. The Knight shift, $\chi_{sp}(0,0)(\delta)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U &lt; U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $\delta_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $\delta=\delta_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microscopic Origin of the Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Vacancy-Ordered Halide Double Perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$= Cl, Br, and I)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06501</link><description>arXiv:2602.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ have recently attracted significant attention due to their intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$), which is highly desirable for thermal insulation and thermoelectric applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, based on a unified theory of thermal transport for crystals and glasses. All studied compounds are found to exhibit ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ below 1.0~W\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ at room temperature and large derivation from the conventional $T^{-1}$ temperature dependence. Our analysis combining with machine-learning approach show that low sound velocities (1100 -- 1600~m\,s$^{-1}$), which originates from the intrinsically weak chemical bonding, play a crucial role in suppressing heat transport of the most compounds, instead of the strong scattering of rattling phonon modes expected from the large void in the structure. Furthermore, the influence of $B$ and $X$-site elements on phonon dispersion, anharmonicity, and scattering phase space is clarified. Our results provide microscopic insights into the origin of ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Cs$_2BX_6$ and offer guiding principles for the rational design of halide-based materials with tailored thermal transport properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moir\'e heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06656</link><description>arXiv:2602.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06656v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From Symmetry to Stability: Structural and Electronic Transformation in Cs$_2$KInI$_6$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06893</link><description>arXiv:2602.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cs$_2$KInI$_6$ is a promising lead-free halide double perovskite with a calculated direct band gap of 1.24 eV, ideal for solar cell applications. Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06893v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06065</link><description>arXiv:2602.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rare Event Analysis of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06791</link><description>arXiv:2602.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tissue-Intrinsic Shape Mechanics in Growing Pre-Migratory Tumor Spheroids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07551</link><description>arXiv:2408.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of pre-migratory tumors is the progressive loss of compact morphology. To investigate how tumors may intrinsically regulate their shape during growth, we employ a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model of multicellular aggregates that incorporates key structural features of tumor spheroids, including its surface, a proliferative rim, and a necrotic core. Focusing exclusively on tumor-intrinsic mechanical interactions, we examine how their collective effects guide morphological evolution en route to metastasis. We show that spheroids acquire lobulated morphologies through an interplay between differential tensions at the spheroid surface and the living-necrotic interface (LNI), together with differential growth within the proliferative rim. In addition, spheroid shapes can be substantially modulated by tissue rheological properties emerging from active, cell-scale forces. Our cell- and tissue-scale simulations of tumor morphologies are enabled by a computational framework that overcomes a major limitation of 3D vertex models - the lack of cell-division - by introducing a graph-based polyhedral-division algorithm within the Graph Vertex Model (GVM).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.07551v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18064</link><description>arXiv:2501.18064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.18064v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] exaPD: A highly parallelizable workflow for multi-element phase diagram (PD) construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01400</link><description>arXiv:2510.01400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase diagrams (PDs) illustrate the relative stability of competing phases under varying conditions, serving as critical tools for synthesizing complex materials. Reliable phase diagrams rely on precise free energy calculations, which are computationally intensive. We introduce exaPD, a user-friendly workflow that enables simultaneous sampling of multiple phases across a fine mesh of temperature and composition for free energy calculations. The package employs standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques, as implemented in the LAMMPS package. Various interatomic potentials are supported, including the neural network potentials with near {\it ab initio} accuracy. A global controller, built with Parsl, manages the MD/MC jobs to achieve massive parallelization with near ideal scalability. The resulting free energies of both liquid and solid phases, including solid solutions, are integrated into CALPHAD modeling using the PYCALPHAD package for constructing the phase diagram.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01400v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link><description>arXiv:2602.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link><description>arXiv:2602.05545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05545v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] When machine learning models learn chemistry II: applying WISP to real-world examples</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00399G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00399G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00399G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kerrin Janssen, Jan M.

Here, the Sn-substituted &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type Mg&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based solid solution was synthesized via spark plasma sintering, and its transport properties were investigated through experimental and theoretical aspects. Sn at Sb sites in Mg&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; softens the chemical bonding, and Sn-Sb 5p orbital overlapping introduces resonant states, resulting in an enhanced density of states. The improved carrier concentration of 1.47  × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and electrical conductivity of 324 S/cm, with the Seebeck coefficient of 133 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;V/K, yielded a maximum power factor of 579.8 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;W/mK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 753 K. Additionally, Sn doping induced lattice disorders, and point defects led to reduced the sound velocity of 2225 m/s, resulting in a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.72 W/mK at 753 K. The synergistic effect of an enhanced power factor and suppressed thermal conductivity resulted in a maximum &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; of 0.43 at 753 K for Mg&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.94&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a next-generation disruptive photovoltaic technology, yet their advancement is constrained by the complexity of perovskite recipe with high-dimensional material and process design space. Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error. Our approach can effectively enable LLM comprehend the domain knowledge, which can efficiently navigate in a high-dimensional, capable to accelerate the advancement in real-world perovskite as well as other material science development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics of SEI Formation in Concentrated LiTFSI and LiPF6 Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05141</link><description>arXiv:2602.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy-density lithium metal batteries require electrolytes that enable fast ion transport and form a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) to sustain high-rate cycling, a process that remains challenging to capture experimentally. Here, we develop a Deep Potential-based machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework, trained on extensive ab initio datasets and validated against experimental transport properties, to resolve early-stage SEI nucleation at lithium metal interfaces with quantum accuracy. We find that at the Li-metal interface, 3.5 M LiTFSI/DMC induces spontaneous, thermally activated reduction reactions, yielding rapidly growing thick anion-derived SEIs enriched in O/F-containing species. In contrast, 1.5-2.5 M LiTFSI/DMC and 1 M LiPF6/EMC/DMC/EC form thinner, LiF-dominated interphases with slower growth kinetics. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental observations, where 3.5 M LiTFSI enhances cycling stability and rate capability, while lower concentrations result in weaker passivation. Our MLMD framework efficiently captures the electrolyte transport and early-stage SEI formation mechanisms in LMBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond overcomplication: a linear model suffices to decode hidden structure-property relationships in glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05313</link><description>arXiv:2602.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing reliable and interpretable structure-property relationships in glasses is a longstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. While modern data-driven machine learning techniques have proven highly effective in establishing structure-property correlations, many models are criticized for lacking physical interpretability and being task-specific. In this work, we identify an approximate linear relation between structure profiles and disorder-induced responses of glass properties based on first order perturbation theory. We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials. We further devise regularization analysis to further enhance the interpretability of our model, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical insight. Overall, this linear relation establishes a simple yet powerful connection between structural disorder and spectral properties in glasses, opening a new avenue for advancing their studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-principles study of photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties of AgBiSCl2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05355</link><description>arXiv:2602.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the potential of the hybrid anion semiconductor AgBiSCl2 for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for high-performance energy conversion devices. Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. In contrast, Bi-S bonds exhibit stronger, directional interactions, which help stabilize the overall structure. The coexistence of weak bonding and strong lattice coupling enables favorable modulation of thermal transport properties.Optically, AgBiSCl2 possesses a high static dielectric constant and exhibits strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. In terms of thermal transport, phonon spectrum exhibit mode hardening with temperature increasing. The localized Ag vibrations intensify the anharmonicity, reducing phonon lifetimes and group velocities.For electronic transport, the p-type material maintains a higher Seebeck coefficient than the n-type, while the latter shows greater electrical conductivity. At 700 K, the figure of merit reaches 0.77 for p-type and 0.69 for n-type AgBiSCl2, indicating promising high-temperature thermoelectric performance.In summary, AgBiSCl2 exhibits excellent potential for dual photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications. Its unique bonding features and lattice response mechanisms offer valuable insights into designing multifunctional energy conversion materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CatFlow: Co-generation of Slab-Adsorbate Systems via Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05372</link><description>arXiv:2602.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering heterogeneous catalysts tailored for specific reaction intermediates remains a fundamental bottleneck in materials science. While traditional trial-and-error methods and recent generative models have shown promise, they struggle to capture the intrinsic coupling between surface geometry and adsorbate interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CatFlow, a flow matching-based framework for de novo design and structure prediction of heterogeneous catalysts. Our model operates on a primitive cell-based factorized representation of the slab-adsorbate complex, reducing the number of learnable variables by an average of 9.2x while explicitly encoding the surface orientation of the slab-adsorbate interface. Experiments on the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset demonstrate that CatFlow significantly improves the structural fidelity of generated catalysts compared to autoregressive and sequential baselines. Further experiments show that the generated structures accurately capture the adsorption energy distributions of physically plausible interfaces and lie closer to thermodynamic local minima.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link><description>arXiv:2602.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05545v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Broken neural scaling laws in materials science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05702</link><description>arXiv:2602.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Path Sampling for Rare Events Boosted by Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05167</link><description>arXiv:2602.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study by Jung et al.

By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02610</link><description>arXiv:2505.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV--visible absorption spectrum of {\it trans}-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S$_1$ and S$_2$. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure--spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S$_2$ peak occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N=N bond within the C--N=N--C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.02610v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Grokking in the Ising Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25966</link><description>arXiv:2510.25966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delayed generalization, termed grokking, in a machine learning calculation occurs when the increase in test accuracy is delayed relative to the training accuracy. This paper examines grokking in the context of a dense neural network trained to classify 2D Ising model configurations into 4 equally spaced energy regions in the presence of weight decay. Partially with the aid of novel PCA-based network layer analysis techniques, the observed behavior is interpreted as a transition from a connected network to a group of sparse subnetworks in which the number of active weights in each layer decreases monotonically with depth. This architecture reduces classification errors resulting from a multiplicity of paths. The final network layers, as in a convolutional neural network, sequentially identify global features of the input classes, which enables generalization to previously unseen patterns.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25966v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $\mu$SR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21013</link><description>arXiv:2511.21013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) in ion diffusion were performed using the {\sl extended} Kubo-Toyabe (KT) relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ that incorporates an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function for the jump motion of ions. The analysis of the generated $\mu$SR spectra using the conventional KT function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t;\Delta_{\rm KT},\nu_{\rm KT})$ (mimicking the previous analysis procedure) suggest that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21013v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19482</link><description>arXiv:2601.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realizations of the simultaneous microscopic observation of interaction-driven charge order and genuine Mott localization, which are the defining hallmarks of a Wigner-Mott insulator, have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered superstructure at one-third filling hosts a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. The spontaneous relaxation from excited states back to the ground state demonstrates that this Wigner-Mott phase is stabilized by the cooperative effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Our results provide direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism and establish 6R-TaS$_2$ as a platform for the controlled realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19482v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Flux-pump induced degradation of $T_1$ for dissipative cat qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00975</link><description>arXiv:2410.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.00975v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Continuous invariant-based asymmetries of periodic crystals quantify deviations from higher symmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13746</link><description>arXiv:2510.13746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations.
  We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on several Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that about a half of simulated crystals have high values of CIA, while all experimental structures in these datasets have CIA=0. On another hand, many crystals with high values Z' in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'&lt;=1 due to low values of CIAs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13746v3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] A montmorillonite-based oral fermentation system enables long-lasting in-situ biosynthesis to restore intestinal homeostasis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69071-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 06 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69071-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69071-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Intestinal homeostatic imbalance represents a hallmark of various diseases.

Abstract: Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Driven Crystal System Prediction for Perovskites Using Augmented X-ray Diffraction Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04435</link><description>arXiv:2602.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of crystal system from X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra is a critical task in materials science, particularly for perovskite materials which are known for their diverse applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn.

Abstract: The design of sustainable materials requires access to materials performance and sustainability data from literature corpus in an organized, structured and automated manner. Natural language processing approaches, particularly large language models (LLMs), have been explored for materials data extraction from the literature, yet often suffer from limited accuracy or narrow scope. In this work, an LLM-based pipeline is developed to accurately extract alloy-related information from both textual descriptions and tabular data across the literature on high-entropy (or multicomponent) alloys (HEA). Specifically two databases with 37,711 and 148,069 entries respectively are retrieved; one from the literature text, consisting of alloy composition, processing conditions, characterization methods, and reported properties, and other from the literature tables, consisting of property names, values, and units. The pipeline enhances materials-domain sensitivity through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation and achieves F1-scores of 0.83 for textual extraction and 0.88 for tabular extraction, surpassing or matching existing approaches. Application of the pipeline to over 10,000 articles yields the largest publicly available multicomponent alloy database and reveals compositional and processing-property trends. The database is further employed for sustainability-aware materials selection in three application domains, i.e., lightweighting, soft magnetic, and corrosion-resistant, identifying multicomponent alloy candidates with more sustainable production while maintaining or exceeding benchmark performance. The pipeline developed can be easily generalized to other class of materials, and assist in development of comprehensive, accurate and usable databases for sustainable materials design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structures of iron and cobalt bimetallic clusters for optimized chemical vapor deposition growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04606</link><description>arXiv:2602.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate iron-cobalt (Fe-Co) alloys as a representative high-performance catalyst system for SWCNT growth in a systematic manner by combining chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments with chirality-resolved spectroscopic analysis, as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory-derived machine learning force fields while varying the Fe-Co ratio. Using zeolite-based SWCNTs prepared by alcohol CVD, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional excitation-emission fitting was employed to quantify chirality-specific growth efficiency. Two distinct growth regimes were identified. At a relatively low temperature of 600 C, pure Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity, promoting efficient growth of small-diameter (0.7-0.9 nm) SWCNTs. In contrast, at 850 C, the Fe0.75Co0.25 alloy shows a pronounced enhancement in growth efficiency compared with pure Fe, pure Co, and other Fe-Co compositions, also yielding larger diameter tubes (0.9-1.1nm). Similar growth behavior was observed on SiO2 substrates, enabling detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of catalyst nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of small, uniform Fe-Co nanoparticles with Co-enriched surfaces, in excellent agreement with MD simulations. Lastly, MD results are summarized in a composition-diameter phase diagram that rationalizes the experimentally observed growth trends. The exceptional performance of the Fe0.75Co0.25 catalyst at high temperature is attributed to the stabilization of small and uniform catalyst clusters, providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic roles of alloy composition and temperature in SWCNT growth.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalar machine learning of tensorial quantities -- Born effective charges from monopole models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04773</link><description>arXiv:2602.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting tensorial properties with machine learning models typically requires carefully designed tensorial descriptors. In this work, we introduce an alternative strategy for learning tensorial quantities based on scalar descriptors. We apply this approach to the Born effective charge tensor, showing that scalar (monopole) kernel models can successfully capture its tensorial nature by exploiting the definition of the Born effective charge tensor as the derivative of the polarisation with respect to atomic displacements. We compare this method with tensorial (dipole) kernel models, as established in our previous work, in which the tensorial structure of the Born effective charge is encoded directly in the kernel and obtained via its derivative. Both approaches are then used for charge partitioning, enabling the separation of monopole and dipole contributions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by computing finite-temperature infrared spectra for a range of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomistic and data-driven insights into the local slip resistances in random refractory multi-principal element alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04827</link><description>arXiv:2602.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) have attracted growing interest for their exceptional high-temperature strength, yet their complex compositions hinder a mechanistic understanding of plastic deformation. Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DMFlow: Disordered Materials Generation by Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04734</link><description>arXiv:2602.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From Evaluation to Design: Using Potential Energy Surface Smoothness Metrics to Guide Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04861</link><description>arXiv:2602.04861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04861v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link><description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.07189v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it achieves predictive performance that is comparable to or exceeds that of state-of-the-art black-box models and consistently outperforms existing white-box symbolic regression methods. The resulting expressions provide physical insights; for example, in the oxygen-ion conductor problem, they elucidate oxygen-ion transport in terms of the coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Kagome Superconductors YRu3B2 and LuRu3B2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16945</link><description>arXiv:2512.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16945v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link><description>arXiv:2602.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03546v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Electrolyte chemistry of adaptive hydrogen bonded domains for high voltage lithium metal batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69160-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 05 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69160-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69160-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lithium metal batteries face challenges of unstable interfaces and slow ion transport.

As Peter Norvig states, “&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Somewhat remarkably, almost all AI research until very recently has assumed that the performance measure can be exactly and correctly specified in the form of a utility or reward function&lt;/span&gt;” [S. J. Russell and P. Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Pearson, 2020)]. Once the reward function is known, any problem can be formulated as an optimization or search problem—the areas well explored within the AI community. However, while the long-term objectives of a specific activity are often well defined, constructing short-term rewards that remain aligned with those goals and consistent with real-world constraints remains a major unresolved challenge. Such alignment has been achieved in domains such as chess, Go, and supervised machine learning problems, where objectives are well defined and easily simulated. However, no universal solution exists for defining intermediate rewards for complex, evolving scientific goals, which remains an open challenge. Correspondingly, the key to operationalizing automated instruments, integrating multi-instrument self-driving laboratories, and building geographically distributed research facilities is to generate experiment-aligned, probabilistic, domain-specific reward functions. These rewards must be consistent with long-term experimental objectives while remaining actionable on the timescales of decision-making on laboratory tools in microscopy and materials synthesis labs—proper reward definition operationalizes scientific intent. Here, we review the extant reward structures in the physical sciences and summarize opportunities for reward design informed by physical principles, human heuristics, and LLM-based reasoning.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/4/1/010901/3378647/Bringing-ML-to-the-real-world-Rewards-are-all-we</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Optical spectra prediction using three-body information</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/053302/3378742/Optical-spectra-prediction-using-three-body</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Obtaining accurate optical spectra is equally necessary for a fundamental physical understanding of semiconductors on the one hand and their technological and economic utilization on the other hand, as well as for many research questions in between, but it remains a challenge both experimentally and theoretically.

Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal conductivity in noncollinear magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03326</link><description>arXiv:2602.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic memory and logic devices, including prospective ones based on skyrmions, inevitably produce heat. Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Complex Materials Discovery with Universal Machine-Learning Potential-Driven Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03369</link><description>arXiv:2602.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have become powerful tools for accelerating computational materials discovery by replacing expensive first-principles calculations in crystal structure prediction (CSP). However, their effectiveness in identifying new, complex materials remains uncertain. Here, we systematically assess the capability of a uMLIP (i.e.,M3GNet) to accelerate CSP in quaternary oxides. Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03438</link><description>arXiv:2602.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Modeling of Charge-Density-Wave Recovery After Laser Melting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03761</link><description>arXiv:2602.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning ORDER-Aware Multimodal Representations for Composite Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02513</link><description>arXiv:2602.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link><description>arXiv:2602.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link><description>arXiv:2506.08112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08112v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Opposite impact of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity on the phonon-limited resistivity of elemental metals from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17478</link><description>arXiv:2511.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding electrical resistivity in metals remains a central challenge in quantifying charge transport at finite temperature. Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity. We show that both effects exert an opposite impact on electron-phonon coupling and on electrical resistivity. Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.17478v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link><description>arXiv:2601.09705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20134</link><description>arXiv:2601.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 \deg$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20134v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modelling Realistic Multi-layer devices for superconducting quantum electronic circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02178</link><description>arXiv:2411.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02178v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link><description>arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12387v4</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Customized composition of lithium metal solid-electrolyte interphase by electric field modulation of anion motion direction</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68498-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 04 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68498-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68498-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;High-voltage lithium-metal batteries face safety and stability challenges.

As the demand for compact, high-performance emitters grows, there is increasing interest in structurally reconfigurable SPR systems that operate in the near-field regime—where enhanced light confinement, subwavelength field shaping, and spatial focusing become accessible. However, conventional SPR designs, which treat gratings as homogeneous and indivisible structures, lack the fine-grained tunability required for coordinated spectral and spatial control and inherently support parasitic surface modes. Here, we fill this key gap by introducing an innovative design paradigm. Specifically, we disassemble traditional grating structures into a programmable array of discrete functional units, simulate the electromagnetic response of each unit via CST particle-in-cell simulations, and ultimately assemble these pre-characterized units into a reconfigurable grating. This design paradigm embeds spectral and spatial control at the unit level, enabling frequency locking through Doppler compensation, energy convergence via directional alignment, and suppression of surface-bound modes by breaking Bloch symmetry. Additionally, this design paradigm allows near-field SPR to achieve coherent and focused emission without reliance on external optics. Furthermore, our grating structure demonstrates robustness against variations in electron velocity and electron position. Our results pave the way for developing on-chip terahertz sources and programmable free-electron-based light sources.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051103/3378617/Near-field-coherent-and-focused-free-electron</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning-based time-series forecasting prevents electrode corrosion in organic electrochemistry</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00458F</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00458F" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00458F, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Josef Tausendschön, Michael Poelzl, Nikola Petrovic, Jason D.

Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link><description>arXiv:2602.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] QUASAR: A Universal Autonomous System for Atomistic Simulation and a Benchmark of Its Capabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00185</link><description>arXiv:2602.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00242</link><description>arXiv:2602.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interatomic potentials for platinum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00379</link><description>arXiv:2602.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new interatomic potentials for platinum (Pt) in angular-dependent potential (ADP) and modified Tersoff (MT) formats. Both potentials have been trained on a reference database of first-principles calculations without using experimental data. The properties of Pt predicted by the ADP and MT potentials agree better with DFT calculations and experimental data than the potentials available in the literature.

Abstract: Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (&gt;450 {\deg}C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effect of the electronic band delocalization and bond anharmonicity on the thermoelectric performance of Cs2TeX6(X=Cl, Br, I)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00562</link><description>arXiv:2602.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free double halide perovskites Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00590</link><description>arXiv:2602.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Van Hove singularity-induced multiple magnetic transitions in multi-orbital systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00698</link><description>arXiv:2602.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (VHSs) amplify electronic correlations, providing a crucial platform for discovering novel quantum phase transitions. Here, we show that VHSs in multi-orbital systems can stabilize a variety of competing $\bm{Q}=0$ magnetic orders, including intrinsic altermagnetism emerging from spontaneous orbital antiferromagnetism. This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching. Through Hubbard-$U$-$J_H$ phase diagrams we map several magnetic phase transitions: (i) ferrimagnet to $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet, (ii) $d$-wave intrinsic altermagnet to ferromagnet, and (iii) $g$-wave extrinsic altermagnet to either $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet or ferromagnet. Our work identifies VHSs as a generic route to altermagnetism in correlated materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A New Workflow for Materials Discovery Bridging the Gap Between Experimental Databases and Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00756</link><description>arXiv:2602.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Open-Source Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Nanoscale Ionic Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00806</link><description>arXiv:2602.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01149</link><description>arXiv:2602.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AI Meets Plasticity: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01215</link><description>arXiv:2602.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm of scientific discovery, namely data-driven science, across nearly all scientific disciplines. In materials science and engineering, AI has already begun to exert a transformative influence, making it both timely and necessary to examine its interaction with materials plasticity. In this study, we present a holistic survey of the convergence between AI and plasticity, highlighting state-of-the-art AI methodologies employed to discover, construct surrogate models for, and emulate the plastic behavior of materials. From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity. By doing so, this work aims to provide a clear road map for researchers and practitioners in the materials community, while offering deeper physical insight and intuition into the role of AI in advancing materials plasticity and characterization, an area of growing importance in the emerging AI-driven era.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards knowledge-based workflows: a semantic approach to atomistic simulations for mechanical and thermodynamic properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01358</link><description>arXiv:2602.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01859</link><description>arXiv:2602.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermophysical properties of spark plasma sintered UCo: a comparison with machine learning predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01896</link><description>arXiv:2602.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01981</link><description>arXiv:2602.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01981v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02228</link><description>arXiv:2602.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02237</link><description>arXiv:2602.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear light cone spreading of correlations in a triangular quantum magnet: a hard quantum simulation target</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02433</link><description>arXiv:2602.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Open Materials Generation with Inference-Time Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00424</link><description>arXiv:2602.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01710</link><description>arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning determines the Mg2SiO4 P-T phase diagram</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01730</link><description>arXiv:2602.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358</link><description>arXiv:2505.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.10358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoconfined Grain Boundaries Increase Conductivity of Polycrystalline Molecular Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12172</link><description>arXiv:2508.12172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12172v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link><description>arXiv:2510.01419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01419v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Automated laboratory x-ray diffractometer and fluorescence spectrometer for high-throughput materials characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14905</link><description>arXiv:2511.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.14905v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067</link><description>arXiv:2512.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01067v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven active learning approaches for accelerating materials discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link><description>arXiv:2601.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials discovery is a cornerstone of modern technological advancement, yet it remains constrained by traditional trial-and-error paradigms and the inherent bias of human intuition. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in materials science by effectively modeling structure-property relationships. Despite substantial efforts to enhance model expressiveness, data efficiency remains an equally critical challenge, given the limited availability of experimental and computational resources. Active learning (AL), as a data-driven machine learning paradigm, has shown great promise for discovering novel materials and enabling the efficient navigation of vast materials spaces. In this review, we follow the evolution of sampling strategy design techniques in AL, from Bayesian optimization to advanced deep learning-based strategies. We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future perspectives of AL in materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06971v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02023</link><description>arXiv:2506.02023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02023v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979</link><description>arXiv:2601.16979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16979v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22389</link><description>arXiv:2601.22389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22389v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Lattice anharmonicity effects in fluorite oxide single crystals and anomalous increase in phonon lifetime in ceria at elevated temperature</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051902/3378532/Lattice-anharmonicity-effects-in-fluorite-oxide</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We investigate the temperature dependence of the frequency and linewidth of the triply degenerate T&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; zone-centered optical phonon in flux-grown ceria and hydrothermally synthesized thoria single crystals from room temperature to 1273 K using Raman spectroscopy. Both crystals exhibit an expected increase in the phonon linewidth with temperature due to enhanced phonon–phonon scattering. However, ceria displays an anomalous linewidth reduction in the temperature range of 1023–1123 K. First-principles phonon linewidth calculations considering cubic and quartic phonon interactions within temperature-independent phonon dispersion fail to describe this anomaly. A parameterization of the temperature-dependent second-order interatomic force constants based on previously reported phonon dispersion measured at room and high temperatures predicts a deviation from the monotonic linewidth increase, albeit at temperatures lower than those observed experimentally for ceria. The qualitative agreement in the trend of temperature-dependent linewidth suggests that lattice anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization plays a role in phonon lifetime. Specifically, a change in the overlap between softened acoustic and optical branches in the dispersion curve reduces the available phonon scattering phase space of the Raman-active mode at the zone center, leading to an increased phonon lifetime within a narrow temperature interval. These findings provide insights into higher-order anharmonic interactions in ceria and thoria, motivating further investigations into the role of anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization on phonon lifetimes at high temperatures.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051902/3378532/Lattice-anharmonicity-effects-in-fluorite-oxide</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] From Pretrained to Precision: Fine-Tuning Universal Interatomic Potentials for Accurate Catalytic Reaction Simulations</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455/asset/images/medium/ct5c01455_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:37:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Solvent Footprint in Wet-Chemical Processing of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985/asset/images/medium/nz5c03985_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpretable Machine Learning for Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738/asset/images/medium/nn5c21738_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c21738&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:53:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Cavity magnonics investigates hybrid systems where magnons interact coherently with photons, providing a platform to harness light-matter interaction in magnetic materials. Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results. Our findings demonstrate a scalable approach to enhancing Kerr anharmonicity in hybrid magnon-photon systems while preserving strong coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen in Brownmillerite Perovskites: First-Principles Insights into Energetics and Induced Electronic-Magnetic Changes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22353</link><description>arXiv:2601.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Turning Insulators into Accelerators: Deciphering the Interfacial Conductivity Boost in ZrO2-Li2ZrCl6 Composites through Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22612</link><description>arXiv:2601.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide solid-state electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for all-solid-state lithium batteries due to their high oxidative stability and deformability, yet their moderate ionic conductivity remains a bottleneck. While incorporating ionically insulating ZrO2 nanoparticles (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 2459) has been experimentally shown to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6, the atomistic origin governing this interfacial phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we bridge the spatiotemporal gap in modeling complex heterostructures by developing an accurate machine-learned force fields based on neuroevolution potential, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 heterostructures. By systematically investigating four representative low-lattice-mismatch ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 interfaces, we identify spontaneous interfacial amorphization driven by space-charge effects upon surface cleavage, trapping Li+ and leading to under-coordinated Li+ polyhedrons with pronounced geometric distortion. These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution. This work establishes a computational framework for training validated machine-learned force fields for interfaces and provides mechanistic understandings of the interfacial conductivity boost in the insulator-conductor composites, guiding the rational design of electrolytes toward next-generation solid-state batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Incorporating Gibbs free energy into interatomic potential fitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22671</link><description>arXiv:2601.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to fit high-temperature Gibbs free energy data for the development of interatomic potentials for atomic systems. The approach is based on Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, enabling the identification of suitable potential parameters such that the system's free energy matches a specified target. The method can be readily combined with conventional fitting techniques for properties such as elastic tensors and liquid pair distribution functions. We validate the effectiveness of the approach using the Uhlenbeck-Ford model and embedded-atom method potentials for pure Ni phases and binary Fe1-xOx liquids under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Our framework provides an efficient strategy for incorporating free energy into interatomic potential fitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SpinWaveToolkit: Python package for (semi-)analytical calculations in the field of spin-wave physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23227</link><description>arXiv:2601.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python package, SpinWaveToolkit (SWT), for (semi-)analytical modeling of spin-wave dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films and exchange-coupled magnetic bilayers. SWT combines analytical models based on the Kalinikos-Slavin theory with a semi-analytical dynamic-matrix approach, enabling the calculation of dispersion relations, group velocities, decay lengths, mode profiles, and static equilibrium magnetization states. In addition, SWT implements a quantitative model of micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) that incorporates vectorial optical focusing, spin-wave Bloch functions, magneto-optical coupling, and Green-function propagation to simulate experimentally measured BLS spectra. The package is validated against finite-element dynamic-matrix simulations performed with TetraX for Damon-Eshbach, backward-volume, forward-volume, and oblique-field geometries, showing excellent agreement while reducing computation times by nearly two orders of magnitude in comparison to the numerical simulations. Thanks to the easiness of the use and fast calculation times, SWT can be used not only for exploratory mapping of the parameter space, but also for the fitting of the measured dispersion relations and related parameters. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for experiment design, interpretation, and parameter optimization for magnonics research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22173</link><description>arXiv:2601.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link><description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Framework for the Bayesian Calibration of Complex and Data-Scarce Models in Applied Sciences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22890</link><description>arXiv:2601.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we review the theory involved in the Bayesian calibration of complex computer models, with particular emphasis on their use for applications involving computationally expensive simulations and scarce experimental data. In the article, we present a unified framework that incorporates various Bayesian calibration methods, including well-established approaches. Furthermore, we describe their implementation and use with a new, open-source Python library, ACBICI (A Configurable BayesIan Calibration and Inference Package). All algorithms are implemented with an object-oriented structure designed to be both easy to use and readily extensible. In particular, single-output and multiple-output calibration are addressed in a consistent manner. The article completes the theory and its implementation with practical recommendations for calibrating the problems of interest. These guidelines -- currently unavailable in a unified form elsewhere -- together with the open-source Python library, are intended to support the reliable calibration of computational codes and models commonly used in engineering and related fields. Overall, this work aims to serve both as a comprehensive review of the statistical foundations and (computational) tools required to perform such calculations, and as a practical guide to Bayesian calibration with modern software tools.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810</link><description>arXiv:2601.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link><description>arXiv:2601.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12941v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Publisher Correction: Machine learning predicts meter-scale laboratory earthquakes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67571-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Machine learning predicts meter-scale laboratory earthquakes</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Design of transient plasma photonic structure mirrors for high-power lasers using deep kernel Bayesian optimisation</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02505-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02505-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-026-02505-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Machine learning is used to design and optimise compact, robust plasma photonic mirrors for ultra-powerful lasers.

Neuromorphic computing offers a brain-inspired approach that unifies computation and memory within a single hardware framework, enabling massively parallel, low-power information processing. Among various device candidates, memtransistors incorporate a gate terminal that enables independent modulation of resistive switching and channel conductance, thereby allowing the realization of complex learning functions and effectively suppressing sneak-path currents in array architectures. This perspective outlines the operation principles of memtransistors based on diverse physical mechanisms, including ion migration, charge trapping, ferroelectric switching, and phase transitions, and then discusses recent materials and architectural engineering strategies, with particular emphasis on two-dimensional channels and scalable array integration. Beyond device-level behavior, bio-inspired functionalities, such as heterosynaptic and homeostatic plasticity, are highlighted as key ingredients for stable and self-regulated learning in neural networks. The integration of memtransistors with sensory modules is further examined to enable near-sensor and in-sensor computing, paving the way for multimodal signal processing that parallels biological perception. Finally, critical challenges and opportunities in variability control, CMOS-compatible processing, and three-dimensional, multisensory integration are identified, indicating that continued progress in material design and architecture optimization will be essential for positioning memtransistors as key enablers of autonomous, bio-inspired intelligence in future robotics, healthcare, and cognitive electronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/020901/3378038/Memtransistor-for-bio-inspired-neuromorphic</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Amorphous solids exhibit structural short-range order despite lacking long-range crystalline order, with this structural descriptor found to be important for determining mechanical properties. Nanobeam electron diffraction offers a potential route for experimental characterization of structural short-range order, yet efforts to date have been primarily qualitative in nature. In this work, machine learning approaches based on transfer learning are used to enable quantitative analysis of nanobeam electron diffraction data from amorphous solids. A ResNet-18 model is trained on virtual diffraction patterns taken from different locations within simulated metallic glasses and amorphous grain boundary complexions in the Cu-Zr alloy system that were created with hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder parameter is found to be a superior target structural descriptor compared to traditional Voronoi indices for this task. The model achieves a low validation mean absolute error across diffraction patterns corresponding to different interaction volumes, demonstrating excellent performance and potential transferability. Testing was performed using other simulated nanobeam electron diffraction data as well as experimental nanobeam electron diffraction patterns, showing that the model can reliably capture spatial variations in local structural state. As a whole, this framework is able to overcome the challenges in the quantitative experimental characterization of structural short-range order, enabling improved characterization of amorphous solids and the exploration of structure-property relationships.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21311</link><description>arXiv:2601.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Screening 39 billion protostructures for materials discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21393</link><description>arXiv:2601.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale computational surveys are increasingly used to map the landscape of stable crystalline materials. We report a high-throughput energy screening of inorganic crystals that enumerates binary and ternary compositions up to a specified unit-cell complexity, yielding 39 billion protostructures. Candidates predicted to lie on or near the convex hull are retained, and their degrees of freedom are explored via Latin hypercube sampling followed by relaxation with machine-learned interatomic potentials. The resulting dataset contains 81 million locally relaxed crystal structures spanning 4495 ternary phase diagrams constructed from elements ranging from lithium to bromine and contains 88,498 crystal prototypes not present in existing crystal-structure databases. The methods are validated both for three well-explored materials systems, Zr-Zn-N, Ti-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N, and by comparing with known data for structures resulting from the larger screening. The work provides a systematic map of low-energy compositional-structural space and a large, structured pool of candidates for downstream property evaluation and materials design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sustainable Materials Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21527</link><description>arXiv:2601.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MEIDNet: Multimodal generative AI framework for inverse materials design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22009</link><description>arXiv:2601.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Double-Bracket Master Equations: Phase-Space Representation and Classical Limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20925</link><description>arXiv:2601.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056</link><description>arXiv:2601.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21103</link><description>arXiv:2601.21103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soft Quantization: Model Compression Via Weight Coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21219</link><description>arXiv:2601.21219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522</link><description>arXiv:2601.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21721</link><description>arXiv:2601.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-agent Framework for Physical Laws Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16416</link><description>arXiv:2411.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering explicit physical laws has traditionally depended on human intuition and domain expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a new route to accelerate this process by automating key steps from hypothesis generation to interpretable model construction. Here we develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework for physical-law discovery that integrates literature-guided variable selection, hypothesis formulation, symbolic regression, formula derivation, and mechanistic explanation. We validate the framework on three representative materials problems: the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses, the Vickers hardness of compounds, and the Young's modulus of multi-component alloys. Using physically and chemically meaningful descriptors as inputs, the discovered formulas achieve strong agreement with reference data, with correlation coefficients up to 0.94 (GFA), 0.86 (hardness), and 0.94 (Young's modulus), while remaining compact and interpretable. Beyond fitting, the Young's modulus formula generalizes to quaternary and quinary alloys, improving prediction accuracy by up to 78.8% relative to the classical rule of mixtures. By integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, reflection mechanisms, and expert-like reasoning ability into symbolic regression, our AI-centric framework offers a robust and extensible platform for automated physical laws discovery, demonstrating that AI can increasingly serve as an essential role in modern scientific research by thinking and acting like field experts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.16416v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous lattice anharmonicity and spin-lattice coupling in spin orbit coupled halide K2IrBr6</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08204</link><description>arXiv:2503.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition-metal halides offers a fertile platform for exploring correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of structural symmetry breaking on lattice vibrations and local spin environments in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes successive cubic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transitions at 170 K and 122 K, respectively, driven by cooperative distortions of the IrBr6 octahedra. Raman spectroscopy reveals anomalous phonon linewidth broadening and unconventional temperature dependence of phonon energies near these transitions, indicating that dynamic spin-phonon coupling is significant well above the Neel temperature (16 K). First-principles phonon calculations support the mode assignments and demonstrate that symmetry-lowering distortions significantly renormalize vibrational modes, consistent with the experimental observations. Complementary EPR measurements detect anisotropic g-factors, resonance field shifts, and linewidth narrowing across the structural transitions, reflecting the emergence of static spin-lattice correlations mediated by spin-orbit entanglement. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system where halide ligand fields, octahedral distortions, and SOC collaboratively govern spin-lattice coupling, providing chemical pathways to engineer quantum materials with tunable magnetic and lattice responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.08204v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05781</link><description>arXiv:2601.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05781v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] Enhanced ion conductivity and stability against Li metal in Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes for high-performance all-solid-state batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847826000183?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 28 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ying Liang, Chuangjie Guo, Ying Qi, Hetian Chen, Haocheng Yuan, Dengfeng Yu, Peipei Ding, Yue Li, Hong Liu, Yaoyu Ren, Xue Zhang, Ce-Wen Nan&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 01:58:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847826000183</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Machine Intelligence] On the troubling rise of generative AI suspicion in academic publishing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Machine Intelligence, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42256-026-01178-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;On the troubling rise of generative AI suspicion in academic publishing</description><author>Nature Machine Intelligence</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Statistical physics for artificial neural networks</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011311/3378335/Statistical-physics-for-artificial-neural-networks</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields.

Abstract: We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $\pi$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced N\'eel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Applied to Materials Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20097</link><description>arXiv:2601.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were proposed as an alternative to traditional neural network architectures based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP-NNs). The potential advantages of KANs over MLP-NNs, including significantly enhanced parameter efficiency and increased interpretability, make them a promising new regression model in supervised machine learning problems. We apply KANs to prediction of materials properties, focusing on a diverse set of 33 properties consisting of both experimental and calculated data. We compare the KAN results to random forest, a method that generally gives excellent performance on a wide range of properties predictions with very little optimization. The KANs were worse, on par, or better than random forest about 35%, 60%, and 5% of the time, respectively, and KANs are in practice more difficult to fit than random forest. By tuning the network architecture, we found property fits often resulted in 10-20% lower errors compared to the standard KAN, and typically gave results comparable to random forest. In the specific context of predicting reactor pressure vessel transition temperature shifts, we explored the parameter efficiency and the interpretable power of KANs by comparing predictions of simple KAN models (e.g., &lt; 50 parameters) and closed-form expressions suggested by the KAN fits to previously published deep MLP-NNs and hand-tuned models created using domain expertise of embrittlement physics. We found that simple KAN models and the resulting closed-form expressions produce prediction errors on par with established hand-tuned models with a comparable number of parameters, and required essentially no domain expertise to produce. These findings reinforce the potential applicability of KANs for machine learning in materials science and suggest that KANs should be explored as a regression model for prediction of materials properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20134</link><description>arXiv:2601.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 \deg$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Morphological Stability of Metal Anodes: Roles of Solid Electrolyte Interphases (SEIs) and Desolvation Kinetics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20751</link><description>arXiv:2601.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable lithium metal anodes requires control over the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation kinetics. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework integrating ion transport, desolvation, charge transfer, and SEI breakdown to predict morphological instabilities during electrodeposition. Using linear stability analysis, we identify six dimensionless parameters that govern the onset and evolution of instabilities. We show that SEI transport and desolvation rate effectively modulate apparent reaction kinetics, shifting the system toward a stable, reaction-limited regime. Extending the classical limiting current concept, we demonstrate that a thick, poorly conductive SEI and sluggish desolvation significantly reduce the limiting current. We introduce an apparent Damk\"ohler number to quantify the critical balance: suppressing diffusion-limited instabilities by reaction rate reduction, while maintaining a high limiting current. Our theory enables predictive mapping of electrodeposition morphologies across diverse materials and operating conditions, guiding the rational design of stable lithium metal anodes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20836</link><description>arXiv:2601.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moir\'e materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moir\'e band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal Analog Computing: Application to Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22603</link><description>arXiv:2503.22603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $&gt;99\%$ in most cases across a pool of matrices with dimensions $2\times2$ and $3\times3$. We apply this methodology -- termed thermal analog computing -- to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These findings open new avenues for analog information processing in thermally active environments, including temperature-gradient sensing in microelectronics and thermal control systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.22603v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Materials design based on a material-motif network and heterogeneous graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17170</link><description>arXiv:2601.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link><description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11703v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or early-stage tool generation, limiting their adaptability and scalability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search, code extraction, and memory utilization; self-reflection via introspection, knowledge graph exploration, and others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v2</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Sustainable Cellulose Biopolymers with Tunable Ionic Conductivity and Adhesion for High‐Performance Solid‐State Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.74272?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:24:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.74272</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] ArXiv says submissions must be in English: are AI translators up for the job?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00229-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The preprint repository’s requirement could boost the use of large language models to translate scientific texts.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Machine-learning-guided tungsten single atoms promote oxyhydroxides for noble-metal-free water electrolysis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68735-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68735-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68735-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sustainable hydrogen production requires efficient oxygen evolution catalysts.

Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated design of proton exchange membranes for green hydrogen production with artificial intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18914</link><description>arXiv:2601.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly method for hydrogen production that has reached significant levels of technological maturity. Among commercialized water-electrolysis technologies, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers offer high current density, fast dynamic response, and compact system design, among other advantages. On the other hand, managing their high capital cost and the ``forever-chemistry'' nature of Nafion, a perfluorinated proton-exchange membrane widely used in such devices, remains a major challenge. Searches for fluorine-free replacements for Nafion, pursued largely through physical experimentation, have been active for decades with limited success. In this work, we develop and demonstrate an AI-based strategy for designing new proton-exchange membranes for electrolyzers. Two key components of this strategy are an implementation of the virtual forward-synthesis approach and a set of machine-learning predictive models for essential application-inspired membrane properties; the former generates a vast space of millions of synthesizable polymers, which are then evaluated and screened by the latter. The strategy is validated against experimental data for known membranes and then applied to design over 1,700 new synthesizable candidates. This article concludes with a forward-looking vision in which the strategy could be elevated into an interactive and iterative scheme that are based on large language models to facilitate materials design in multiple ways.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19371</link><description>arXiv:2601.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interband State Transfer in Double-Gated Bilayer Graphene at High Electric Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19869</link><description>arXiv:2601.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned using double-gated transistors to apply a perpendicular electric field that generates an interlayer potential energy difference $\Delta$. Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $\Delta \ll t_\perp \simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. We find that for $\Delta \simeq t_\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced "knee". Increasing $\Delta$ past the "knee" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$\Delta$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18953</link><description>arXiv:2601.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19034</link><description>arXiv:2601.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Diagrammer's Note on Superconducting Fluctuation Transport for Beginners: II.

Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10392v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link><description>arXiv:2506.00090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00090v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unconventional Josephson effects in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic bilayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08262</link><description>arXiv:2509.08262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects can typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these heterostructures host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal N\'{e}el order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08262v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21778</link><description>arXiv:2509.21778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 &lt; $x$ &lt;= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18069v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21217</link><description>arXiv:2507.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21217v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link><description>arXiv:2509.26201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26201v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Accelerated discovery of supertetragonal perovskites with giant polarization &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; machine learning</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01970-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 28 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01970-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01970-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Accelerated discovery of supertetragonal perovskites with giant polarization &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; machine learning</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01970-w</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Development of Accurate Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Fields Using a Machine Learning and Optimization Approach</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00537J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00537J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Montana N.

Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of the synthetic feasibility of hypothetical zeolite-like materials based on ZeoNet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17253</link><description>arXiv:2601.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suite of classifiers was developed to distinguish real, experimentally realized zeolites from computationally predicted zeolite like structures. Using 3D convolutional neural networks applied to volumetric distance grids, these classifiers achieve accuracies more than an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches based on geometric filters or other machine learning methods. The best-performing model differentiates among hypothetical zeolites and those that can be synthesized as silicates, as aluminophosphates, or as both. This four-class classifier attains a false negative rate of 3.4% and a false positive rate of 0.4%, misidentifying only 1,207 of over 330,000 hypothetical structures -- even though the hypothetical structures exhibit similar formation energies as real zeolites and chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. We hypothesize that the ZeoNet representation captures essential structural features correlated with synthetic feasibility. In the absence of comprehensive physics-based criteria for synthesizability, the small subset of misclassified hypothetical structures likely represents promising candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entropic Efficiency of Bayesian Inference Protocols</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17282</link><description>arXiv:2601.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference is a versatile tool that underlies scientific discovery, machine learning, and everyday decision-making: it describes how an agent updates a probability distribution as partial information is acquired from multiple measurements, reducing ignorance about a system's latent state. We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Interface Structure using the Minima Hopping Method with a Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17291</link><description>arXiv:2601.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting atomic-scale interfacial structures remains a central challenge in materials science due to their structural complexity and the difficulty of direct comparison between computational and experimental results. In this study, we present an efficient approach for interface structure prediction that integrates the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) with the state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), Allegro. We demonstrate that the MHM-Allegro approach provides a robust and computationally efficient route for predicting interfacial structures in the benchmark system SrTiO3 Sigma 3 (112)[110] tilt grain boundaries (GBs), consistently identifying the lowest-energy configurations across different stoichiometries. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy for constructing defect-representative training datasets without explicitly including defective configurations, achieving excellent extrapolative performance in interface predictions. The predictive capability is further validated through direct comparison with experimental observations of the SrTiO3 Sigma 5 (310)[001] GB, where the predicted atomic configurations show strong agreement with experimental measurements. This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between ab initio predictions and experimentally observed interfacial structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The dimensionality of the Hopfield model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17427</link><description>arXiv:2601.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Binary Intrinsic Dimension (BID), a geometrical measure designed for binary data, to analyze the Hopfield model, a paradigmatic spin system from statistical mechanics, machine learning and neuroscience. The BID allows us to characterize the phases and transitions of this system, and moreover it is robust against finite-size effects that interfere with the correct numerical estimation of the spin-glass order parameter ($q$). We observe that the BID scales linearly with system size in the retrieval and paramagnetic phases, where the correlations between spins are small, and exhibits sublinear scaling in the whole spin-glass phase, highlighting its correlated structure. Furthermore, we establish a direct relationship between the BID and the overlap distribution, unveiling a novel connection between the geometry of the state-space and standard spin order parameters.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An autonomous living database for perovskite photovoltaics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17807</link><description>arXiv:2601.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is severely bottlenecked by the inability of manual curation to keep pace with exponential publication rates. This creates a widening knowledge gap. This is especially stark in photovoltaics, where the leading database for perovskite solar cells has been stagnant since 2021 despite massive ongoing research output. Here, we resolve this challenge by establishing an autonomous, self-updating living database (PERLA). Our pipeline integrates large language models with physics-aware validation to extract complex device data from the continuous literature stream, achieving human-level precision (&gt;90%) and eliminating annotator variance. By employing this system on the previously inaccessible post-2021 literature, we uncover critical evolutionary trends hidden by data lag: the field has decisively shifted toward inverted architectures employing self-assembled monolayers and formamidinium-rich compositions, driving a clear trajectory of sustained voltage loss reduction. PERLA transforms static publications into dynamic knowledge resources that enable data-driven discovery to operate at the speed of publication.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An AI-ready fine-tuning framework for accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials in solid-solid battery interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17847</link><description>arXiv:2601.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling of solid-solid battery interfaces is essential for understanding electro-chemo-mechanical coupling, but the complex interfacial chemistry and heterogeneous environments pose major challenges for quantum-accurate, data-efficient modeling. Herein, we propose an approach of fine-tuning with integrated replay and efficiency (FIRE), a general framework for universal machine-learning interatomic potentials by combining efficient configurational sampling with a replay-argumented continual strategy, achieving quantum-level accuracy at moderate cost. Across six solid-solid battery interface systems, FIRE consistently achieves root-mean-square errors in energy below 1 meV/atom and in force near 20 meV/angstrom, marking an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing models while requiring only 10% of the original datasets. In addition, the fine-tuned model successfully reproduces key mechanical and electrochemical properties of the materials, in close agreement with experimental data. The FIRE offers a generalizable and data-efficient approach for developing accurate interatomic potentials across diverse materials, enabling predictive simulations beyond the reach of first-principles methods.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hybridization of topologically distinct quartet modes in three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18036</link><description>arXiv:2601.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions offer a powerful playground for exploring exotic superconducting and topological phenomena beyond the reach of conventional two-terminal devices. In this work, we present the direct spectroscopic observation of Cooper quartet resonances, a signature of correlated tunneling of two Cooper pairs across the device, in a graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ). Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport. To interpret our results, we develop a theoretical model that connects the observed quartet resonances to the coherent hybridization of multiple ABS branches, a hallmark of the rich pairing process enabled by multiterminal geometries. Our results highlight the potential of multiterminal superconducting devices to host engineered superconducting states and pave the way for new approaches to topological band structure design based on phase-controlled, higher-order superconducting transport.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Machine Learning for Soft High-k Elastomers under Data Scarcity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18032</link><description>arXiv:2601.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

Abstract: The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SmoQyDQMC.jl: A flexible implementation of determinant quantum Monte Carlo for Hubbard and electron-phonon interactions (version 2.0 release)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link><description>arXiv:2311.09395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with local and extended Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, including non-linear e-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementation uses an optimized hybrid Monte Carlo method with exact forces to efficiently sample the phonon fields, enabling the simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, is found at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.09395v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Terahertz-driven parametric excitation of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_{3}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06748</link><description>arXiv:2410.06748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in the perovskite structure of LaAlO$_3$ (LAO). Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.06748v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] InSpecLearn4SDL: Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link><description>arXiv:2509.21330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21330v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] LLM tools in the prediction of the stability of perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11615</link><description>arXiv:2512.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting degradation rates is an important task in the development of new perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, we explore the feasibility of solving this problem using Machine Learning models supported by LLM tools. We consider both the "lifetime" prediction of the device and the prediction of degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment, providing rather accurate prediction. The results cover the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available mathematical models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can suggest to PSC designer various PSC models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11615v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link><description>arXiv:2404.14258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.14258v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link><description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.10360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151</link><description>arXiv:2508.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19151v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v3</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This study theoretically investigates the dynamic modulation of QAHE in two-dimensional noncollinear antiferromagnetic (NAFM) kagome organic–metal framework Sc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; under both resonant and non-resonant schemes via Floquet engineering. First-principles calculations demonstrate that in monolayer Sc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the NAFM state exhibits superior magnetic stability compared to the collinear ferromagnetic state, while possessing a symmetry-protected Dirac point below the Fermi level, and this characteristic differentiates it from the lower-energy but topologically trivial antiferromagnetic state. Circularly polarized light (CPL) dynamically breaks mirror symmetry (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;), thereby opening a topologically non-trivial bandgap and generating quantized anomalous Hall conductance. By rotating the magnetic moments, we obtained three typical configurations: Type-I (e.g.,  ϕ=0°) exhibits stable QAHE; Type-II (e.g.,  ϕ=60°) is topologically trivial; Type-III (e.g.,  ϕ=150°) enables optically tunable edge states. Further investigation under low-energy CPL ( ℏω=0.2  eV) reveals chiral-inverted edge channels and higher optical modulation sensitivity, with the required light intensity for quantization reduced by 25% compared to the high-energy regime. Notably, the propagation direction of the surface states is strictly locked to the light helicity; switching the chirality of circular polarization enables reversal of both the edge state direction and the sign of the Chern number.

Abstract: Hafnia (HfO2) is a silicon-compatible dielectric material, yet stabilizing its desired but metastable ferroelectric phase remains challenging. Phase stability predictions by density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial guidance, but most simulations neglected or only treated finite temperature effects with (quasi-)harmonic approximation due to high computational cost of DFT. Here, we develop a machine learning force field and perform thermodynamic calculations for HfO2 using self-consistent phonon theory to address growing evidence of anharmonicity. Our results reveal that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase oIII exhibits metastability below 0.1kBT under most conditions within the simulated regime of temperature and pressure (600 K &lt;= T &lt;= 1500 K and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 7.5 GPa), contradicting previous harmonic predictions of metastability above 1500 K at ambient pressure. We further report evidence for temperature- and pressure-dependent ferroelectric parent phase despite efforts to identify a universal one. This study highlights the importance of anharmonicity and provides an effective approach for its treatment in the design of HfO2-based ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Simulations of High Temperature Decomposition of Metal-Organic Frameworks to form Amorphous Catalysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16459</link><description>arXiv:2601.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16459v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16544</link><description>arXiv:2601.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AI-enhanced discovery and accelerated synthesis of metal phosphosulfides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16693</link><description>arXiv:2601.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal phosphosulfides have emerged as unique multifunctional materials, but they present unique synthesis challenges compared to more established material classes such as oxides and nitrides. As a consequence, experimental development and theoretical understanding of phosphosulfides have focused on individual compounds rather than on accelerated broad-range exploration. In this work, we first evaluate the synthesizability and band gaps of 909 hypothetical ternary phosphosulfides by density functional theory. We find 19 previously unknown thermodynamically stable compounds, including the first Si- and Ge-based phosphosulfides. For rapid band gap prediction, we then develop a multi-fidelity machine learning model to translate semilocal density functional theory band gaps into experimentally calibrated band gaps. Importantly, we extend the accelerated material development workflow to the experimental domain by demonstrating a route to high-throughput synthesis and characterization of virtually any phosphosulfide material system. The method is based on thin-film combinatorial libraries and yields over 100 unique compositions in each experiment, enabling us to synthesize four distinct phosphosulfide compounds in only four combinatorial experiments without prior synthesis recipes and without compromising on material quality. Thus, we argue that accelerated materials development workflows combining theory, artificial intelligence, synthesis, and characterization can be viable even for experimentally challenging inorganic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charting the Landscape of Oxygen Ion Conductors: A 60-Year Dataset with Interpretable Regression Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16852</link><description>arXiv:2601.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are indispensable materials for such as solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, and membranes. Despite extensive research across diverse structural families, systematic data enabling comparative analysis remain scarce. Here, we present a curated dataset of oxygen ion conductors compiled from $84$ experimental reports spanning $60$ years, covering $483$ materials. Each record includes activation energy ($E_a$) and prefactor ($A$) derived from Arrhenius plots, alongside detailed metadata on structure, composition, measurement method, and data source. When the original papers derive these using an erroneous Arrhenius equation $\sigma_T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$, where ($\sigma_T$ is the oxygen ion conductivity at temperature $T$ and $R$ is the gas constant), we replotted these using the correct one, $\sigma_{T}T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$. To illustrate how the database can be used, we constructed interpretable regression models for predicting oxygen ionic conductivity. Two symbolic regression models for E_a and A suggest that oxygen ion transport is primarily governed by local coordination environment and the electrostatic interactions, respectively. This dataset establishes a reliable foundation for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling of next-generation oxygen ion conductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active learning for photonics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16287</link><description>arXiv:2601.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979</link><description>arXiv:2601.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link><description>arXiv:2503.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19720v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Technology is changing how we write — and how we think about writing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00245-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An exploration of how writing systems, from ancient Chinese characters to modern alphabets, shape language, and whether users of ChatGPT can be said to be authors at all.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Self-optimizing machine learning potential assisted automated workflow for highly efficient complex systems material design</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01971-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Self-optimizing machine learning potential assisted automated workflow for highly efficient complex systems material design</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Towards an understanding of photoluminescence in lead-free Cs2AgxNa1-xBiyIn1-yCl6 double perovskites by machine learning prediction from density-functional theory ground state properties</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00152H</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00152H, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Marina Selana Günthert, Larry Lüer, Oleksandr Stroyuk, Oleksandra Raievska, Christian Kupfer, Andres Osvet, Bernd Meyer, Christoph J Brabec&lt;br /&gt;Halide double perovskites are an emerging class of lead-free materials for optoelectronic and photo-voltaic applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Materealize: a multi-agent deliberation system for end-to-end material design and synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15743</link><description>arXiv:2601.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Materealize, a multi-agent system for end-to-end inorganic materials design and synthesis that orchestrates core domain tools spanning structure generation, property prediction, synthesizability prediction, and synthesis planning within a single unified framework. Through a natural-language interface, Materealize enables non-experts to access computational materials workflows and obtain experimentally actionable outputs for material realization. Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] NASICON solid-electrolyte modification and analysis using ion and neutron beams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15845</link><description>arXiv:2601.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 {\deg}C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI \v{R}e\v{z}). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coarsening dynamics of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns: Machine learning assisted characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16006</link><description>arXiv:2601.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link><description>arXiv:2509.26022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26022v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704</link><description>arXiv:2510.04704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04704v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link><description>arXiv:2510.05227v2 Announce Type: replace

We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows.

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08055v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link><description>arXiv:2512.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05717v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Spatial heterogeneity and subtypes of functional connectivity development in youth</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68707-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This study applies machine learning to fMRI data to map developmental variations in functional connectivity, uncovering heterogeneity across individuals and cortical regions that predicts neurocognitive maturation in youth.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Text mining-assisted machine learning prediction and experimental validation of emission wavelengths</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01967-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Text mining-assisted machine learning prediction and experimental validation of emission wavelengths</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Daily briefing: Why cancer might protect against Alzheimer’s disease</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00257-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00257-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00257-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A protein made by cancer cells seems to break down the hallmark plaques of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ionic transport in spontaneously ion-intercalated van der Waals layered structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14836</link><description>arXiv:2601.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11608</link><description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.11608v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect-modified acoustic phonons in a single layer of MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14464</link><description>arXiv:2503.14464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14464v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link><description>arXiv:2509.26022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26022v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] When two years of academic work vanished with a single click</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04064-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 22 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04064-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04064-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;After turning off ChatGPT’s ‘data consent’ option, Marcel Bucher lost the work behind grant applications, teaching materials and publication drafts.

Abstract: Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of Van Hove Singularities: Electronic Fingerprints of 3Q Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Quantum Magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11796</link><description>arXiv:2601.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a rich platform for exploring exotic quantum states in van der Waals magnets. Among them, CoxTaS2 has attracted intense interest following the recent discovery of a distinctive 3Q magnetic ground state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect below a critical doping of x=1/3, both intimately tied to cobalt concentration. To date, direct signatures of this enigmatic 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure remain elusive. Here we report a comprehensive doping dependent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy study that unveils these long-sought fingerprints. Our data reveal an unexpected "inverse Mexican hat" dispersion along the K-M-K direction, accompanied by two van Hove singularities. These features are consistent with theoretical predictions for a 3Q magnetic order near three-quarters band filling on a cobalt triangular lattice. These results provide evidence of 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure, establishing TMD van der Waals magnets as tunable materials to explore the interplay between magnetism and topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Significant impact of Al1-xGaxN interlayer on GaN/AlN thermal boundary conductance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12151</link><description>arXiv:2601.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlN-GaN heterostructures are central to high-power and high-frequency electronics, including RF devices, power converters, and AI accelerators. An intermediate Al1-xGaxN (AlGaN) layer is often present, either unintentionally during growth or intentionally to induce a 2D electron gas, yet its impact on the interfacial thermal boundary conductance (TBC) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable measurement or modeling methods. Here, we report a first principles-based evaluation of the TBCs of AlN-AlGaN, AlGaN-GaN, and AlN-AlGaN-GaN interfaces over the full alloy range. This is realized by the development of accurate deep learning interatomic potentials based on first-principles simulations. Contrary to other material systems where mixed interlayers enhance thermal coupling, we find that an AlGaN interlayer markedly degrades TBC between GaN and AlN, explaining the observation in experiments. Finally, we show that if the Al composition is sigmoidally transitioned from 0 to 1 across the AlN-GaN interface, it can remarkably increase the TBC, compared to an abrupt or a linear transition. This work is expected to shed light on an accurate thermal analysis and electro-thermal co-design of future AlGaN-based devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12170</link><description>arXiv:2601.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moir\'e bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moir\'e valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moir\'e orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence in Materials Science and Engineering: Current Landscape, Key Challenges, and Future Trajectorie</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12554</link><description>arXiv:2601.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] INTERFACE Force Field for Alumina with Validated Bulk Phases and a pH-Resolved Surface Model Database for Electrolyte and Organic Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12570</link><description>arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ontology-aligned structuring and reuse of multimodal materials data and workflows towards automatic reproduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12582</link><description>arXiv:2601.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlation between superfluid density and transition temperature in infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{1-x}Sr_xNiO_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12676</link><description>arXiv:2601.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong correlation between zero-temperature superfluid density ($\rho_{s0}$) and transition temperature ($T_c$) is considered as a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity. However, their relationship has yet to be unveiled in nickelates due to sample inhomogeneity. Here we perform local susceptometry on an infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}NiO_2$. The sample shows inhomogeneous superfluid density and $T_c$ on micron-scale. The spatial statistics for different scan areas reveal a linear dependence of local $T_c$ on $\rho_{s0}$ for $T_c$&gt;8 K and a sub-linear one for $T_c$&lt;8 K. Remarkably, the overall relationship is reminiscent of that reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors, hinting at a close connection between them.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall formation in tetragonal phase BaTiO3 via machine learning potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12914</link><description>arXiv:2601.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be reoriented by an external electric field, forming the basis of various memory, actuator, and sensor applications. The polarization switching behavior, however, is strongly influenced by mechanical boundary conditions due to the intrinsic electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics. In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa. These findings provide atomistic insights into stress-controlled ferroelectric switching and highlight the crucial role of mechanical loading in designing reliable ferroelectric devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale Prediction of Polymer Relaxation Dynamics via Computational and Data-Driven Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12942</link><description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning interatomic potentials for solid-state precipitation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12984</link><description>arXiv:2601.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$\tau$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13125</link><description>arXiv:2601.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Guided Polymorph Selection in Molecular Beam Epitaxy of In2Se3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13156</link><description>arXiv:2601.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13508</link><description>arXiv:2601.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Faster grain-boundary diffusion with a higher activation enthalpy than bulk diffusion in ionic space-charge layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14181</link><description>arXiv:2601.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = \Delta H^\mathrm{gb} / \Delta H^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning model for predicting surface wettability in laser-textured metal alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11661</link><description>arXiv:2601.11661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface wettability, governed by both topography and chemistry, plays a critical role in applications such as heat transfer, lubrication, microfluidics, and surface coatings. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11661v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Development of next-generation light-weight ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12836</link><description>arXiv:2601.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link><description>arXiv:2601.12941v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information transport and transport-induced entanglement in open fermion chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14153</link><description>arXiv:2601.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling pressurized bulk superconductivity in a trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08677</link><description>arXiv:2411.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.08677v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link><description>arXiv:2412.01384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale quantum many-body systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding strongly correlated physics. However, two fundamental problems, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.01384v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Integrable Hamiltonian Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14632</link><description>arXiv:2412.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.14632v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945</link><description>arXiv:2503.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07945v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link><description>arXiv:2506.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10211v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Identification of 2D colloidal assemblies in images: a threshold processing method versus machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21634</link><description>arXiv:2510.21634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 67%.

Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21481v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally driven quantum computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25996</link><description>arXiv:2510.25996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25996v2</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Integrating Thermal Liquid Biopsy, Clinical Data, and Mass Spectrometry for Early Diagnosis and Biomarker Discovery in Colorectal Cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00126-4?rss=yes</link><description>Early detection of colorectal cancer is essential to improving survival, where yet current diagnostic tools show limited performance.

Abstract: Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10997</link><description>arXiv:2601.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Computational Design of Ductile Additively Manufactured Tungsten-Based Refractory Alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11295</link><description>arXiv:2601.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten exhibits exceptional temperature and radiation resistance, making it well-suited for applications in extreme environments such as nuclear fusion reactors. Additive manufacturing offers geometrical design freedom and rapid prototyping capabilities for these applications, provided the intrinsic brittleness and low printability of tungsten can be overcome. Designing tungsten alloys with improved ductility, and thus printability in additive manufacturing, can be accelerated using a computationally derived performance predictor to screen out brittle compositions. Calculations of the Pugh ratio using density functional theory may serve this purpose, given its correlation with ductility. This process can be made more efficient through the use of machine learning interatomic potentials to accelerate density functional theory calculations. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning interatomic potentials can effectively identify optimal alloy compositions in the W-Ta-Nb system along the melting point-Pugh ratio Pareto front. The trend in Pugh ratio as a function of tungsten fraction is explained in terms of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. Experimental validation reveals a strong correlation between the computed Pugh ratio and the observed crack fractions in additively manufactured alloys. Notably, the two alloys predicted to have the highest Pugh ratio values, W20Ta70Nb10 and W30Ta60Nb10, exhibit no intergranular microcracking in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An exciting approach to theoretical spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11388</link><description>arXiv:2601.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory. Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise density-functional theory and time-dependent density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Moreover, we capture resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning. All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientific relevant materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] NAVIS: A LAMMPS-Python framework for efficient computation of nanochannel velocity and thermal interfacial slip</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11391</link><description>arXiv:2601.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Halide diffusion in mixed-halide perovskites and heterojunctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11503</link><description>arXiv:2601.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration of halide defects guides ion transport in metal halide perovskites and controls the kinetics of halide mixing and phase separation. We study the diffusion of halide vacancies and interstitials in \ce{CsPb(I_{x}Br_{1-x})_{3}} and \ce{CsPbI_{3}}/\ce{CsPbBr_{3}} heterojunctions by molecular dynamics simulations using neural network potentials trained on density functional theory calculations. We observe enhanced diffusion of both vacancies and interstitials in the mixed halide compounds compared to the single halide ones, as well as a difference in mobility between Br and I ions in the mixed compound. Diffusion across heterojunctions is governed by the interface structure, where a Br-rich interface blocks migration of vacancies in particular, but an I-rich interface is permeable.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive autoencoder-transformer model of Cu oxidation state from EELS and XAS spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11509</link><description>arXiv:2601.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) produce detailed information about oxidation state, bonding, and coordination, making them essential for quantitative studies of redox and structure in functional materials. However, high-throughput quantitative analysis of these spectra, especially for mixed valence materials, remains challenging as diverse experimental conditions introduce noise, misalignment, broadening of the spectral features. We address this challenge by training a machine learning model consisting of an autoencoder to standardize the spectra and a transformer model to predict both Cu oxidation state and Bader charge directly from L-edge spectra. The model is trained on a large dataset of FEFF-simulated spectra and evaluates model performance on both simulated and experimental data. The results of the machine learning model exhibit highly accurate prediction across the domains of simulated and experimental XAS as well as experimental EELS. These advances enable future quantitative analysis of Cu redox processes under in situ and operando conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Skyrmion Quantum Diode Prototype: Bridging Micromagnetic Simulations and Quantum Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11341</link><description>arXiv:2601.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the temperature and density dependence of dislocation drag from phonon wind</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08650</link><description>arXiv:2104.08650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At extreme strain rates, where fast moving dislocations govern plastic deformation, anharmonic phonon scattering imparts a drag force on the dislocations.

Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.08294v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02367</link><description>arXiv:2504.02367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02367v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] pyRMG: A Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell DFT Calculations on Supercomputers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16775</link><description>arXiv:2509.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16775v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Zinc-based metal halide electrolytes for all-solid-state zinc-metal batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68394-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 19 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68394-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68394-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Zinc-metal batteries are restricted by their inherent high activity of aqueous electrolyte.

Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10382</link><description>arXiv:2601.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128</link><description>arXiv:2601.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR-&gt;DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR-&gt;DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular electrostatic potentials from machine learning models for dipole and quadrupole predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10320</link><description>arXiv:2601.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20929</link><description>arXiv:2504.20929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: a-Quartz surfaces functionalized with hydroxyl and methyl groups provide a versatile platform for controlling interfacial properties critical to applications such as catalysis, protective coatings, and energy conversion. The arrangement of these functional groups strongly influences interfacial interactions at solid-liquid interfaces, highlighting their relevance to colloid and interface science. However, conventional models often treat surface functionalization as spatially homogeneous, overlooking the atomic-scale organization of surface groups. We hypothesize that this spatial distribution, beyond overall composition, plays a decisive role in governing surface stability and interfacial behavior.
  To test this hypothesis, we employ a multi-scale simulation workflow combining density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This approach allows us to explore a range of spatial patterns of OH/CH3 functionalization on the a-quartz (0001) surface. We evaluate the impact of spatial arrangements on mixing energy, hydrogen bonding networks, and vibrational properties with high accuracy and robustness.
  Our results reveal that spatial patterning strongly influences surface stability and interfacial structure. A thermodynamically favored unpaired configuration emerges near 67 % CH3 substitution, where isolated OH groups form secondary hydrogen bonds through reorientation toward subsurface oxygen atoms. This rearrangement induces a characteristic blue shift in OH stretching frequencies, indicating weaker H-bonding. These effects are absent in clustered arrangements. By establishing a clear link between functional group patterning and interfacial behavior, our work uncovers the underlying mechanisms to guide and accelerate the rational design of silica-based materials and coatings, directly relevant to colloid and interface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.20929v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovering quasiorder parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06159</link><description>arXiv:2505.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these quantities, along with a magnetization-like quantity derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative (quasi)order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results clarify, within this specific setting, how reduced spin representations can retain the essential thermodynamic information needed for identifying critical behavior. Taken together, this work establishes a concrete bridge between Ising-trained ML models and critical phenomena in Potts systems by showing that Potts criticality can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, thereby opening avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.06159v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11650</link><description>arXiv:2512.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11650v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link><description>arXiv:2601.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06971v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic AI and Machine Learning for Accelerated Materials Discovery and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09027</link><description>arXiv:2601.09027v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link><description>arXiv:2411.02740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02740v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link><description>arXiv:2508.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04486v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] YBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.5+δ&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;: A family of semiconductors with a charge- and defect-tunable triple fluorite layer</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m3qv9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Abstract: The design and development of new materials is crucial for advanced next-generation technologies, necessitating the modification of materials with tuneable atomic and electronic frameworks.

Specifically, the redox inert nature of these cations, even within some intermetallic compounds, enables one to access exotic oxidation states. Prior work on semiconducting alkali aurides(I-) and platinides(II-) containing transition metal anions stimulated theoretical predictions of the monatomic iridide(III-) anion by reduction of iridium with alkali metals under pressure. We tested these predictions by reacting a K-rich mixture of K and Ir at 19.5(6) GPa and 493 K. This reaction yields K5Ir, which adopts the rare but simple BaSn5 crystal structure. Hybrid functional electronic structure calculations, net atomic charge analysis, and Ir L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal K5Ir is a semimetal with a carrier density ~10^20 cm^−3 which features anionic Ir and both cationic and neutral K on different sites. While the net atomic charge of Ir in K5Ir falls short of that in hypothetical, semiconducting K3Ir, it exceeds those of Pt(II-) in Cs2Pt and Ir(III-) in [Ir(CO)3]^3−, suggesting an extreme for the distribution of charge in the vicinity of a transition metal. First-principles crystal structure prediction corroborates the thermodynamic stability of K5Ir under the preparatory conditions and indicates that several other K−Ir compounds await discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xfdj1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Nanopore sequencing with proteins: synchronization and dischronization of molecular dynamics simulations with laboratory and industrial developments</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0lzw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein nanopores have revolutionized DNA sequencing by enabling long-read, real-time, and portable genomic analysis.

In solid solutions, surface segregation under vacuum can be estimated based on the surface energy of the constituent elements. Upon exposure to ambient conditions, the surface reactivity of the elements, particularly their tendency to oxidize, is also important. Here, we investigate differences between the surface and volume composition of a model noble metal system, Ag-Au-Pd-Pt, fabricated by co-sputter deposition in the form of thin-film materials libraries (MLs), spanning a compositional range of Ag12-55Au7-50Pd6-60Pt7-58. The volume compositions of 684 measurement areas of these libraries were determined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). For each library, a set of nine selected areas was additionally measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to determine the surface compositions, i.e. the first few nanometers of the films. The XPS data reveal surface segregation of Ag up to 8 at.% and Pt depletion of similar magnitude. The results were further validated by large-scale molecular dynamics/Monte-Carlo simulations using accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP), providing theoretical insights of surface segregation under vacuum conditions across the quaternary composition space.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xbjnn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Assignment Promoting Use of Generative AI as an Active Learning Tool in General Chemistry</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7wwr0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for teaching and learning is currently hotly debated.

Although multi-task and representation-learning approaches are commonly used to improve predictive performance, the latent representations learned by such models are rarely examined directly, allowing domain misalignment to remain hidden until model transfer fails. Here, we present a practical, representation-level framework for auditing domain alignment in latent spaces learned by multi-task neural networks for materials property prediction. Using porous carbon materials and metal–organic frameworks as a representative cross-domain case study, we analyze a shared latent space trained across multiple target properties and regularization strategies. Global and local dimensionality-reduction visualizations are combined with quantitative measures of domain separability and latent–target correlation structure to assess alignment quality. We find that domain-alignment objectives induce measurable geometric reorganization and partial large-scale mixing in latent space, while domain identity remains locally recoverable and physically interpretable monotonic associations between latent dimensions and target properties are preserved. These diagnostics reveal structural differences in learned representations that are not apparent from conventional performance metrics alone and enable model comparison based on latent-space geometry rather than predictive accuracy. The proposed auditing framework is model-agnostic and can be readily integrated into existing materials machine learning workflows, providing a practical tool for improving robustness and interpretability in cross-domain materials modeling.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Asymmetric Multi-Site Ion Exchange in Porous Carbon Electrodes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jvqt4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ion transport in porous carbon electrodes underpins the performance of electrochemical energy-storage and separation technologies, yet exchange dynamics within heterogeneous pore networks remain difficult to quantify. Here, we present a rigorous analytical framework for extracting quantitative ion-exchange kinetics in confined electrolytes from two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy (2D EXSY) NMR, explicitly accounting for asymmetric ion populations, relaxation effects, and microscopic reversibility. By describing exchange with a lognormal distribution of rates, the framework captures the intrinsic heterogeneity of ion motion and overcomes the limitations of conventional discrete-site models. Applied to aqueous LiTFSI electrolytes confined in mesoporous CMK-3 and hierarchically structured ST-CMK-3 carbons, the method resolves a hierarchy of ion-exchange processes spanning fast near-surface exchange to slow in-pore diffusion in two and three-site exchange systems. We report the first observation of three-site ion exchange in porous electrodes, revealing enhanced directional ion mobility and higher effective diffusion coefficients at interconnected micro–mesopore boundaries in hierarchical carbons. These findings establish direct, quantitative links between pore architecture and ion-transport efficiency. This distribution-based framework provides a generalizable route to identifying rate-limiting transport pathways in complex porous energy materials and offers design principles for optimizing porous carbons for high-rate supercapacitors, capacitive deionization, and gas-storage applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jvqt4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Materials] Heterogeneous doping via nanoscale coating impacts the mechanics of Li intrusion in brittle solid electrolytes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02465-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Materials, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02465-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41563-025-02465-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short-circuiting during fast charging through lithium dendrite intrusion into electrolytes is a major challenge in solid-state batteries.

20 years, no systematic approach to predict the structural properties of the derived metal oxides is
available. We present an integrated machine learning (ML) approach leveraging Smooth Overlap of
Atomic Positions (SOAP) and multiple ML models, including Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), to predict
thermally derived zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) polymorph from diverse Zr-based precursors. By a systematic
experimental dataset of calcination parameters, we train the ML model to quantitatively forecast material
properties and the weight fraction of crystalline phases of the resulting ZrO2. Experimental validation of
model predictions confirms that the chemical composition of precursors and calcination parameters have
a profound influence on the crystallinity of MOF-derived ZrO2 polymorph. Our findings demonstrate
the utility of small-data-driven predictive ML modeling and transfer learning for guiding the synthesis of
advanced oxide materials providing a blueprint for accelerated discovery of MOF-derived nanomaterials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7lnbc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] The Role of Oxygen Excess on Fluoride Intercalation in Ruddlesden–Popper Electrodes for Fluoride Ion Batteries: The Case of LaSrMnO4</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hcf3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ruddlesden–Popper–type compounds are particularly attractive electrode materials for fluoride-ion batteries. Among them, LaSrMnO4 has received significant attention due to its high fluoride incorporation capability and lower environmental impact compared to nickel- and cobalt-based analogues. In this work, neutron diffraction data are used to provide an experimental visualization of fluoride-ion diffusion in this class of materials, through Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) and Bond Valence Site Energy (BVSE) analysis. Additionally, since oxygen excess is well known in Ruddlesden–Popper oxides but its impact on fluoride-ion transport has not been previously investigated, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to reveal how oxygen over-stoichiometry affects fluoride intercalation mechanisms and energetics, unveiling new migration pathways that hinder fluoride mobility. These findings have direct implications for fluoride-ion battery performance, highlighting the critical role of oxygen content in determining anion transport and the electrochemical performance of this class of materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hcf3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] From Cation Order to Disorder: Unlocking Ion Transport Pathways in Li-Zn-Zr-Cl Halospinels</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zw0j8?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Lithium metal chloride halospinels of the general formula Li2MCl4 are a promising class of earth-abundant ion conductors for all-solid-state batteries. However, poor room-temperature ionic conductivity has historically limited their use in practical applications. Here, we substitute Zr4+ into Li2ZnCl4 along the series Li2−2x/3Zn1−xZr2x/3Cl4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.0) to understand how cation disorder and vacancy tuning impacts ion transport in “normal” halospinels. Aliovalent Zr4+ substitution increases ionic conductivity by nearly five orders of magnitude, from 1.320(3) × 10−9 S cm−1 in Li2ZnCl4 to 6.74(1) × 10−5 S cm−1 for x = 0.6. Average and local structure characterization through synchrotron X-ray diffraction
(SXRD) and neutron pair distribution function (nPDF) analysis reveal that Zr4+ redistributes the Zn2+ and Li+ sublattices into previously unoccupied interstitial sites that form new low-energy hopping pathways that facilitate ion transport. We rationalize the dramatic rearrangement of the cation local structure by considering the coordination
preferences of the cations and the potential electrostatic penalties incurred by the higher-valent Zr4+ cations. This work delivers an atomistic understanding of substitution-induced cation disorder and ion transport properties in a new family of earth-abundant halospinels.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zw0j8?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] OBELiX: A Curated Dataset of Crystal Structures and Experimentally Measured Ionic Conductivities for Lithium Solid-State Electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00441A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00441A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Felix Therrien, Jamal Abou Haibeh, Divya  Sharma, Rhiannon  Hendley, Leah Wairimu Mungai, Sun  Sun, Alain Tchagang, Jiang  Su, Samuel  Huberman, Yoshua Bengio, Hongyu Guo, Alex Hernandez-Garcia, Homin Shin&lt;br /&gt;Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety.

Large-scale benchmarking studies using public datasets have demonstrated the feasibility of building predictive models across hundreds of endpoints. In parallel, automated machine learning (Auto-ML) approaches have emerged as a promising means to lower the barrier to QSAR model development, enabling competitive performance without extensive expert intervention. 
Here, we describe the design and implementation of an automated QSAR modeling system inte- grated into the CDD Vault platform, referred to as CDD Vault Inference Models. The system auto- matically trains, evaluates, and deploys regression models whenever new assay data become available, without requiring users to select endpoints, descriptors, or learning algorithms. Using public datasets from ChEMBL, we developed a fully automated workflow for model training and continuous evaluation. Models are released when a conservative performance threshold is achieved. The system is currently focused on building regression models. To give users a handle on model uncertainty, we also provide conformal prediction intervals. 
We discuss the implications of deploying fully automated QSAR models in a production environ- ment and outline future extensions. Together, this work demonstrates that automated, continuously updated QSAR modeling can provide practical and scalable decision support for drug discovery, par- ticularly in settings where dedicated modeling expertise is limited.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-l1d11?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] pyEF: A Python Framework for QM and QM/MM Atom-Wise Electric Field Analysis</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3cbg4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We introduce pyEF, a software package for computing molecular electric fields, electrostatic interaction energies, and electrostatic potentials from quantum mechanical (QM) atom-centered multipole expansions with atom-wise decomposable contributions. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of this QM-derived electric field evaluation tool through several tests. To assess the influence of the underlying QM method and charge partitioning scheme on these electrostatic quantities, we analyze over 250 configurations of an acetone solute molecule in five solvents of variable polarity. We find that electric field calculations are highly sensitive to the choice of charge partitioning method. Even among real-space charge schemes, acetone Stark tuning rates differ by up to a factor of two. Benchmarking computed solvent dipole moments against experimental bulk values, we conclude that the CM5, ADCH, and Hirshfeld-I charge schemes most reliably capture solvent electrostatics and therefore provide a more faithful foundation for computing electric fields. When constructed from these real-space charges, electric fields are nearly insensitive to basis set size and monotonically increase in magnitude with higher Fock exchange. We also demonstrate efficient convergence of QM electrostatics when more distant molecules are represented solely by MM point charges, reducing computational overhead. Leveraging these findings, we demonstrate the use of pyEF to deduce environmental effects on a transition metal complex from a Ga4L612- nanocage and quantify the dominant role of organic linkers in orchestrating electrostatic preorganization.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3cbg4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] “Active material-free” design to overcome mass-transport limitations for high-energy-density all-solid-state Li-S batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00420-9?rss=yes</link><description>Artificially preloading active materials cannot guarantee effective three-phase contact, where the ionic conductors, electronic conductors, and active materials meet, making it difficult to achieve efficient sulfur utilization.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Driven Creep Law Discovery Across Alloy Compositional Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08970</link><description>arXiv:2601.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hihg-temperature creep characterization of structural alloys traditionally relies on serial uniaxial tests, which are highly inefficient for exploring the large search space of alloy compositions and for material discovery. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic AI and Machine Learning for Accelerated Materials Discovery and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09027</link><description>arXiv:2601.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially AI agents, is increasingly being applied to chemistry, healthcare, and manufacturing to enhance productivity. In this review, we discuss the progress of AI and agentic AI in areas related to, and beyond polymer materials and discovery chemistry. More specifically, the focus is on the need for efficient discovery, core concepts, and large language models. Consequently, applications are showcased in scenarios such as (1) flow chemistry, (2) biosensors, and (3) batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09027v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Exploration and Insights into Temperature-Dependent Phonons in Inorganic Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09123</link><description>arXiv:2601.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons, quantized vibrations of the atomic lattice, are fundamental to understanding thermal transport, structural stability, and phase behavior in crystalline solids. Despite advances in computational materials science, most predictions of vibrational properties in large materials databases rely on the harmonic approximation and overlook crucial temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Here, we present a scalable computational framework that combines machine learning interatomic potentials, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and high-throughput calculations to investigate temperature-dependent phonons across thousands of materials. By fine-tuning the universal M3GNet interatomic potential using high-quality phonon data, we improve phonon prediction accuracy by a factor of four while preserving computational efficiency. Integrating this refined model into a high-throughput implementation of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we compute temperature-dependent phonons for 4,669 inorganic compounds. Our analysis identifies systematic elemental and structural trends governing anharmonic phonon renormalization, with particularly strong manifestations in alkali metals, perovskite-derived frameworks, and related systems. Machine learning models trained on this dataset identify key atomic-scale features driving strong anharmonicity, including weak bonding, large atomic radii, and specific coordination motifs. First-principles validation confirms that anharmonic effects can dramatically alter lattice thermal conductivity by factors of two to four in some materials. This work establishes a robust and efficient data-driven approach for predicting finite-temperature phonon behavior, offering new pathways for the design and discovery of materials with tailored thermal and vibrational properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field report from Collaborative Research Center 1625: Heterogeneous research data management using ontology representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09359</link><description>arXiv:2601.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the Collaborative Research Center 1625 is the establishment of a scientific basis for the atomic-scale understanding and design of multifunctional compositionally complex solid solution surfaces. Next to materials synthesis in form of thin-film materials libraries, various materials characterization and simulations techniques are used to explore the materials data space of the problem. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques guide its exploration and navigation. The effective use of the combined heterogeneous data requires more than just a simple research data management plan. Consequently, our research data management system maps different data modalities in different formats and resolutions from different labs to the correct spatial locations on physical samples. Besides a graphical user interface, the system can also be accessed through an application programming interface for reproducible data-driven workflows. It is implemented by a combination of a custom research data management system designed around a relational database, an ontology which builds upon materials science-specific ontologies, and the construction of a Knowledge Graph. Along with the technical solutions of research data management system and lessons learned, first use cases are shown which were not possible (or at least much harder to achieve) without it.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link><description>arXiv:2601.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models for Metal-Organic Frameworks Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09285</link><description>arXiv:2601.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning aided parameter analysis in Perovskite X-ray Detector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04729</link><description>arXiv:2405.04729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many factors in perovskite X-ray detectors, such as crystal lattice and carrier dynamics, determine the final device performance (e.g., sensitivity and detection limit). However, the relationship between these factors remains unknown due to the complexity of the material. In this study, we employ machine learning to reveal the relationship between 15 intrinsic properties of halide perovskite materials and their device performance. We construct a database of X-ray detectors for the training of machine learning. The results show that the band gap is mainly influenced by the atomic number of the B-site metal, and the lattice length parameter b has the greatest impact on the carrier mobility-lifetime product ({\mu}{\tau}). An X-ray detector (m-F-PEA)2PbI4 were generated in the experiment and it further verified the accuracy of our ML models. We suggest further study on random forest regression for X-ray detector applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.04729v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link><description>arXiv:2506.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08112v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Review and Machine Learning Prediction of Diamond Vacancy Center Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02808</link><description>arXiv:2507.02808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here, we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.02808v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04843</link><description>arXiv:2510.04843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04843v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Design of corrosion resistant Ce-enhanced hybrid solid electrolyte interphase by Ce(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additives for lithium metal batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001465?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 150&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mingdong Du, Yanxia Liu, Chenxing Wang, Fulai Qi, Mingyu Shi, Wenjing Liu, Shengnan He, Zhijun Wu, Zhenglong Li, Chenchen Li, Hongge Pan&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:41:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001465</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Assigning the Stereochemistry of Natural Products by Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zz9pw-v4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nature has settled for L-chirality for proteinogenic amino acids and D-chirality for the carbohydrate backbone of nucleotides. Further stereochemical patterns exist among natural products produced by common biosynthetic pathways. Here we asked the question whether these regularities might be sufficiently prevalent among natural products (NPs) such that their stereochemistry could be machine learned and assigned automatically. Indeed, we report that a language model can be trained to assign the stereochemistry of NPs using the open access NP database COCONUT. In detail, our language model, called NPstereo, translates an NP structure written as absolute SMILES into the corresponding isomeric SMILES notation containing stereochemical information, with 80.2% per-stereocenter accuracy for full assignments and 85.9% per-stereocenter accuracy for partial assignments, across various NP classes including secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, polyketides, lipids and terpenes. NPstereo might be useful to assign or correct the stereochemistry of newly discovered NPs. Scientific contribution: Our study reports that a language model, NPstereo, can learn and predict the stereochemistry of natural products (NPs) from their 2D structures with high accuracy. This work demonstrates that NP stereochemical patterns are machine learnable from data and represents a first step for scalable computational methodologies for stereochemical assignment of newly discovered NPs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zz9pw-v4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Advancing Calcium-Ion Batteries with a Novel Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hxjcm-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ca-ion batteries (CIBs) have garnered significant attention in the past few years by virtue of their economic and physicochemical advantages, positioning them as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology in the post-lithium-ion battery era. However, the current research progress is insufficient, leaving this emerging field far from practical application, most of which focuses on developing high-performance electrode materials. Herein, we design a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) prepared by mixing Ca(ClO4)2·4H2O and acetamide at room temperature. The solvation structure of Ca2+ can be precisely regulated by controlling the molar ratio of the two chemical components. The HEE with optimal formulation features a wide electrochemical stability window, good ionic conductivity, appropriate viscosity, and a low melting point. Employing this novel HEE, a full CIB assembled with a PEDOT/V2O5 cathode and a PTCDI anode demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance at room temperature (30 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1 after 30,000 cycles) and environmental adaptability within a wide operating temperature range (−20 to 60 ℃). This work may not only provide a sustainable, safe, and cost-effective electrolyte for CIBs but also pave the way for the comprehensive development of CIBs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hxjcm-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DFT-guided discovery of bisureido ester of 2-(methylthio)ethanol: A novel lead against triple-negative breast cancer inducing apoptosis via pH-sensitive chloride transport</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Dysregulation of transmembrane chloride flux has emerged as a promising strategy for inducing cancer-cell death through disruption of intracellular pH gradients and subsequent apoptosis. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel ortho-phenylenediamine (o-PDA) bisurea derivatives bearing carboxyl (5a–f) and 2-(methylthio)ethyl ester (6a,b) groups for pH-sensitive anion transport and resultant anticancer activity. Esterification of 5c–f proved synthetically challenging due to an unprecedented CDI-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization that yielded the 4-oxo-benzo[d][1,3,6]oxadiazepines 8a,b, rationalized via a DFT-supported four-step mechanism involving hydrogen-borrowing catalysis. All target compounds demonstrated 1:1 chloride ion-binding as shown by 1H NMR titration results and demonstrated a pH-gradient-induced transmembrane chloride transport (as shown by vesicular transport studies) which was enhanced by electron-withdrawing substituents on the outer phenyl rings. Ester derivatives 6a,b exhibited significantly higher chloride binding and up to ~67-fold increased transport efficiency over their carboxylic acid analogs. Compound 6b emerged as the lead, combining efficient chloride binding (Ka = 163 M⁻¹), potent transport (EC50 = 0.007 mol%), and superior antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 6.34 µM) against MDA-MB-231 cells via apoptosis induction. These findings establish 6b as a promising lead for chloride-transport-mediated cancer therapy, with further optimization recommended via EWG diversification and strategic consideration of the cyclization pathway in retrosynthetic design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Nanotechnology] Superionic composite electrolytes with continuously perpendicular-aligned pathways for pressure-less all-solid-state lithium batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Nanotechnology, Published online: 15 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41565-025-02106-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Highly ionically conductive and flexible solid-state composite battery electrolytes are engineered by alternately stacking inorganic LixMyPS3 (M = Cd or Mn) nanosheets with lithium-containing organic polymers in a perpendicular orientation to the surface of the electrodes.</description><author>Nature Nanotechnology</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Mechanistically guided residual learning for battery state monitoring throughout life</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67565-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 15 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67565-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67565-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ensuring accurate state monitoring is vital for battery safety and efficiency in electric vehicles.

The resulting abundance of data, generated by quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics sim- ulations, and chemical machine learning natu- rally raises questions about accuracy, precision, and reliability, as well as the systematic treat- ment of errors and uncertainties. Addressing these questions through rigorous mathematical frameworks is at the heart of Uncertainty Quan- tification.

The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed.

We report atomic-scale &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; TEM studies of delithiation and lithiation in multi-particle LFP coupled to a Li-rich garnet (LLZNO) solid electrolyte. During delithiation, LFP converts to a metastable L&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;FP via a periodicity-doubling mechanism (every second layer) accompanied by the emergence of a solid-solution zone, and we directly observe interparticle Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport that drives reversible LFP–L&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;FP–LFP cycles. Conversely, under reductive bias, lithiation proceeds by an interface-dominated crystalline–amorphous transformation, identifying amorphization as a primary particle-level failure pathway.

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $\Phi$ crosses integer values. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little--Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-aware Conditional Generation of Crystal Structures Using Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08115</link><description>arXiv:2601.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of generative models in crystal structure prediction (CSP) has gained significant attention. Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A microscopic origin for the breakdown of the Stokes Einstein relation in ion transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08309</link><description>arXiv:2601.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08309v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DataScribe: An AI-Native, Policy-Aligned Web Platform for Multi-Objective Materials Design and Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07966</link><description>arXiv:2601.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines. DataScribe functions as an application-layer intelligence stack, coupling data governance, optimization, and explainability rather than treating them as downstream add-ons. We validate the platform through case studies in electrochemical materials and high-entropy alloys, demonstrating end-to-end data fusion, real-time optimization, and reproducible exploration of multi-objective trade spaces. By embedding optimization engines, machine learning, and unified access to public and private scientific data directly within the data infrastructure, and by supporting open, free use for academic and non-profit researchers, DataScribe functions as a general-purpose application-layer backbone for laboratories of any scale, including self-driving laboratories and geographically distributed materials acceleration platforms, with built-in support for performance, sustainability, and supply-chain-aware objectives.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v4</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Sequence-based generative AI design of versatile tryptophan synthases</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68384-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 14 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68384-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68384-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Enzymes are highly selective and sustainable catalysts for chemical synthesis, but their optimization is often limited by the difficulty of identifying functional starting points.

Here, we demonstrate a mixed-halide strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity of lithium tetrahaloaluminates, LiAlX4 (X = Cl, Br, I). Twenty compositions, including single-, binary-, and ternary-halide systems, were synthesized via a mechanochemical route. Their ionic conductivities were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, while the local environments of Li and Al were investigated using solid-state NMR in combination with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).  A conductivity map was constructed from the experimental data using a ternary diagram. The highest conductivity is observed near the center of the Cl-Br-I compositional triangle, where the configurational entropy is maximized. XRD patterns indicate that both binary and ternary mixed-halide samples retain the overall framework structure. 27Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR reveals multiple X combinations of AlX4- units in the binary and ternary systems, consistent with random anion mixing. 7Li MAS NMR spectra exhibit motional narrowing that correlates with enhanced ionic conductivity, particularly in the ternary compositions.  The activation energy and pre-exponential factor extracted from Arrhenius plots of the conductivity follow the Meyer-Neldel rule. These results suggest that the Li+ migration barrier can be overcome through the annihilation of multi-phonon excitation modes. The enhanced ionic conductivity achieved via increased compositional complexity highlights the potential of entropy-driven design strategies for next-generation solid-state batteries.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sxpz5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Coupled Cluster Free Energies for Atmospheric Molecular Clusters: Benchmark and Matching Experimental Free Energies</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0jz1q?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The initial formation of secondary aerosols, a large cause of uncertainty in modern radiative forcing modeling, can be simulated using quantum chemical methods. When based on quantum chemistry, the simulations have an exponential dependence on the free energy, requiring a high-accuracy description. In this study, we have computed harmonic frequencies and quasi-harmonic free energies for a set of 10 monomers and 29 dimers relevant for atmospheric molecular clusters at the DF-CCSD(F12b)(T*)/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory. The set is used to benchmark the M06-2X, PW91, ωB97X-D3BJ functions with the Jensen, Karlsruhe, and Pople style basis sets. The composite methods B97-3c, r2SCAN-3c, and ωB97X- 3c are also tested. We find ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP to be an optimal choice as it has low errors (mean absolute error of 0.13 kcal/mol) and few outliers in the thermal contribution. For calculations on larger clusters, B97-3c stands out. Using the ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP and B97-3c level of theories, we compute anharmonic frequencies using the VPT2 method and determine an anharmonic scaling factor of 0.961 and 0.953 for ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP and B97-3c frequencies, re- spectively. The scaling factor together with incorporating multi-conformer entropy ef- fects and a high-level single-point correction at the Nnormal LNO-CCSD(T)/CBS(aug- 3,aug-4) are used to compare to experimental determined free energies of the 11 hydrogen-bonded systems. We find that we obtain sub 1 kcal/mol errors when incor- porating the scaling factor, the multi-conformer entropy effects, and the single point correction.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0jz1q?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Exploring the Spectral Signatures of Large Amplitude Motions in the CH Stretching Region of the Vibrational Spectrum of CH5+</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-pw3b1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The spectra of CH5+ and its deuterated analogues are challenging to interpret due to the very flat potential surface and the highly delocalized ground state wave function.   In this work, an approach is developed to model the spectra of CH5+ and CH4D+.  In this approach, several thousand geometries are sampled from the ground-state probability amplitude, which is evaluated using diffusion Monte Carlo.  For each structure, the potential energy is minimized with respect to the five CH bond lengths, and the frequencies and intensities for the five 1-0 transitions involving the CH or CD stretching vibrations are then evaluated using a five-dimensional harmonically-coupled anharmonic oscillator model and a sum of one-dimensional cuts through the dipole moment surface. This information is used to obtain the spectrum by two approaches.  To model the lower-resolution laser-induced reaction spectrum, the calculated spectrum is obtained by convoluting the spectra obtained at all of the sampled structures.  To model the helium droplet spectrum, in which the individual CH transitions are resolved, the spectrum is obtained by averaging the Hamiltonian matrices and transition moment vectors over the sampled structures.  We find that these approaches reproduce reported spectra.  Analysis of the helium droplet spectrum leads us to conclude that in this environment the isomerization of CH5+ in its ground state is restricted compared to the gas-phase.  Overall, this approach provides a simple and physically transparent way to connect fluxional structures to CH-stretch spectral patterns, and offers frameworks for interpreting future spectroscopic studies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-pw3b1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] PervoTransformer: Transformer-Based PCE Prediction
and Device Design with MACE MLIPs for CsSnX3 Perovskites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Perovskite solar cell performance depends on the joint configuration of materials, interfaces, and
layer-specific physical parameters, forming a structured design space that is naturally sequential but
rarely modeled as such. This work introduces PervoTransformer, a transformer-based framework that
represents complete device architectures as sequences and learns device-level behavior directly from
this representation. A RoBERTa model is finetuned on SCAPS-generated device sequences spanning
six perovskite families, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, CsPbI3, and their Sn-based analogs. The model
predicts multiple performance metrics simultaneously, including power conversion efficiency (PCE),
short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and fill factor (FF), demonstrating that
transformer encoders can capture coupled, non-linear dependencies across the full device stack. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of transformer models to perovskite solar
cell device modeling using a sequence-based formulation. To explore device configurations beyond the
training distribution, a GPT-2 model is finetuned on the same device sequence formalism and used to
generate candidate architectures with novel combinations of compositional and physical parameters.
Generated sequences are screened for validity, uniqueness, and physical consistency using a retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) based constraint system. The validated devices are then passed back
through the finetuned RoBERTa model to predict performance metrics, enabling selection of high performing
candidates. Selected absorber configurations are further evaluated through device-level
simulations, forming an end-to-end loop for device prediction, generation, and screening. Additionally
machine-learned interatomic potentials based on the MACE framework are finetuned for CsSnX(X =
Cl,Br, I)3 using available DFT data, enabling efficient exploration of structural and energetic trends
in lead-free Sn perovskites and supporting absorber materials design. Together with the transformer based
predictive, generative, and screening workflow, this establishes a multi-scale strategy in which
sequence-aware transformers optimize device architectures while MLIPs guide atomic-scale materials
exploration for perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Framework of Copolymer gel Dynamics and Ligand Interaction Factors, Objective-free exploration, and CVT-MAPElites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4kmdq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Discovery-oriented research is a fundamental pursuit in chemical and materials science, especially when objective-free or purpose-ambiguous exploration can yield unexpected novel compounds or materials. Recently, data-driven objective-free exploration methods have emerged to support such discovery in materials science. However, these methods have mostly been limited to relatively simple systems (e.g., chemical composition), and extending them to real-world multiscale, multi-component materials like soft matter remains a critical challenge. In this study, we present a novel framework for objective-free exploration of a complex gel–ligand interaction system that integrates multiscale data. We embed monomer physicochemical information using four different large-language models (LLMs), and combine these embeddings with polymer dynamics descriptors obtained via time-domain NMR measurements. Using this combined representation, we perform novelty-driven search with BLOX (BoundLess Objective-free eXploration) and utilize CVT-MAP-Elites to map candidates in an interpretable behavioral characteristic space. Unlike conventional molecular descriptors, the LLM-based embedding supports a much broader and richer exploration of gel-ligand interaction space evaluated by 13C NMR signal intensities. The results demonstrate that our framework uncovers a wider diversity of candidate materials than descriptor-based approaches, thereby establishing a new pathway for discovery-oriented design of functional materials that integrates multiscale and multi-feature information.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4kmdq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] What if We Were to Design Transport in Aqueous Electrolytes Using Learnings from Lithium Battery Research?</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t8p83?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Electrolyte design has played a crucial role in the development of lithium batteries for a range of applications.

Abstract: Amorphous oxyhalides have attracted significant attention due to their relatively high ionic conductivity ($&gt;$1 mS cm$^{-1}$), excellent chemical stability, mechanical softness, and facile synthesis routes via standard solid-state reactions. These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Predicted ZT: Machine Learning Strategies for the Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06571</link><description>arXiv:2601.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials for advancing green energy harvesting from waste heat is an urgent need in the context of looming energy crisis and climate change. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent "gap" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the "small-data" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring "hidden hierarchies" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML "fast filters" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735</link><description>arXiv:2601.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bgolearn: a Unified Bayesian Optimization Framework for Accelerating Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06820</link><description>arXiv:2601.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of vast compositional and processing spaces is essential for accelerated materials discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a principled strategy for identifying optimal materials with minimal experiments, yet its adoption in materials science is hindered by implementation complexity and limited domain-specific tools. Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows. Bgolearn supports both single-objective and multi-objective Bayesian optimization with multiple acquisition functions (e.g., expected improvement, upper confidence bound, probability of improvement, and expected hypervolume improvement etc.), diverse surrogate models (including Gaussian processes, random forests, and gradient boosting etc.), and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06820v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoindentation induced plasticity in equiatomic MoTaW alloys by experimentally guided machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06846</link><description>arXiv:2601.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCA) exhibit exceptional strength and thermal stability, yet their plastic deformation mechanisms under complex contact loading remain insufficiently understood. Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}&lt;111&gt; slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations.

Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Case study of an exploratory high voltage NASICON-based Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ cathode material for sodium-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07012</link><description>arXiv:2601.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in the Type-I Superconductor YbSb$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07460</link><description>arXiv:2601.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry is a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity, typically observed in type-II superconductors. Here, we report evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the type-I superconductor YbSb$_2$. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal spontaneous internal magnetic fields emerging just below the superconducting transition, while transverse-field $\mu$SR confirms a fully gapped type-I superconducting state. Our first-principles calculations identify YbSb$_2$ as a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological metal hosting a Dirac nodal line near the Fermi level. Symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg Landau framework indicates an internally antisymmetric nonunitary triplet (INT) state as the most probable superconducting ground state. Calculations based on an effective low-energy model further demonstrate that this INT state hosts gapless Majorana surface modes, establishing YbSb$_2$ as a topological superconductor. Our results highlight YbSb$_2$ as a unique material platform where type-I superconductivity coexists with triplet-pairing and nontrivial topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning nonequilibrium phase transitions in charge-density wave insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07583</link><description>arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07583v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
